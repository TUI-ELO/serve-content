The **tui** ([Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language "Māori language"): _tūī_; _Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae_) is an [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism "Endemism") [passerine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine "Passerine") bird of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand"), and the only species in the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus "Genus") _**Prosthemadera**_. It is one of the largest species in the diverse Australasian [honeyeater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyeater "Honeyeater") family (Meliphagidae), and one of two living species of that family found in New Zealand, the other being the [New Zealand bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird "New Zealand bellbird") (_Anthornis melanura_). The tui has a wide distribution in the archipelago, ranging from the subtropical [Kermadec Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermadec_Islands "Kermadec Islands") to the sub-Antarctic [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands "Auckland Islands"), as well as the main islands.

## Contents

## Name

The bird's [common name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_name "Common name") _tui_ comes from the [Māori language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language "Māori language") (where it is now spelled _tūī_). The plural is _tui_ in modern English, or _ngā tūī_ in Māori usage;[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-2) some speakers still use the '-s' suffix to produce the Anglicised form _tuis_ to indicate plurality, but this practice is becoming less common.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-3) Early European colonists called it the **parson bird**[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-4) or **mockingbird**;[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-5) however, these names are no longer used.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-6)

## Description

Adult and young tui _|_ _A History of the Birds of New Zealand_, Buller,1888

The tui is a large honeyeater, 27 to 32 cm (11–13 in) in length. The Chatham Islands subspecies is larger on average than the nominate subspecies, and heavier. Males tend to be heavier than females. Nominate males weigh between 65–150 g (2.3–5.3 oz), and females 58–105 g (2.0–3.7 oz). Males of the Chatham subspecies are 89–240 g (3.1–8.5 oz) and females 89–170 g (3.1–6.0 oz).[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-hbw-7)

At first glance the bird appears completely black except for a small tuft of white feathers at its neck and a small white wing patch, causing it to resemble a [parson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson "Parson") in clerical attire. On closer inspection (see image) it can be seen that tui have brown feathers on the back and flanks, a multicoloured [iridescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescent "Iridescent") sheen that varies with the angle from which the light strikes them, and a dusting of small, white-shafted feathers on the back and sides of the neck that produce a lacy collar.

## Distribution and habitat

Tui are found through much of New Zealand, particularly the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island "North Island"), the west and south coasts of the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island "South Island"), [Stewart Island/Rakiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island/Rakiura "Stewart Island/Rakiura") and the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands "Chatham Islands")—where an endangered sub-species particular to these islands exists. Other populations live on [Raoul Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Island "Raoul Island") in the [Kermadecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermadec_Islands "Kermadec Islands"),[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-8) and in the [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands "Auckland Islands") (where, with the [New Zealand bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird "New Zealand bellbird"), it is the most southerly species of honeyeater).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-9) Populations have declined considerably since European settlement, mainly as a result of widespread [habitat destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction "Habitat destruction") and predation by [mammalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal") [invasive species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species "Invasive species").

Nonetheless, the species is considered secure and has made recoveries in some areas, particularly after removal of livestock has allowed vegetation to recover. Predation by [introduced species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species "Introduced species") remains a threat, particularly [brushtail possums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_brushtail_possum_in_New_Zealand "Common brushtail possum in New Zealand") (which eat eggs and chicks), [stoats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat "Stoat"), the [common myna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_myna "Common myna") (which competes with tui for food and sometimes takes eggs), and rats.

Tui prefer [broadleaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadleaf "Broadleaf") forests below 1500 metres,\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] but will tolerate quite small remnant patches, regrowth, exotic plantations and well-vegetated suburbs. They are one of the most common birds found in urban [Wellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington "Wellington"). They are usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small family groups, but will congregate in large numbers at suitable food sources, often in company with [silvereyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvereye "Silvereye"), bellbirds, or [kererū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerer%C5%AB "Kererū") (New Zealand wood pigeon) in any combination. Generally, when [interspecific competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interspecific_competition "Interspecific competition") for the same food resources among New Zealand's three species of honeyeater occurs, there is a hierarchy with the tui at the top, then bellbirds and [stitchbirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitchbird "Stitchbird") successively subordinate to the species above them—they are thus frequently chased off by tui at a food source such as a flowering flax plant.

Tui defending a food source from a much larger kaka parrot

Male tui can be extremely aggressive, chasing all other birds (large and small) from their [territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal) "Territory (animal)") with loud flapping and sounds akin to rude human speech. This is especially true of other tui when possession of a favoured feeding tree is impinged. Birds will often erect their body feathers in order to appear larger in an attempt to intimidate a rival. They have even been known to [mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_(animal_behavior) "Mobbing (animal behavior)") [harriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_harrier "Swamp harrier") and [magpies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpies_in_New_Zealand "Australian magpies in New Zealand").[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-DOC-10)

The powered flight of tui is quite loud as they have developed short wide wings, giving excellent maneuverability in the dense forest they prefer, but requiring rapid flapping. They can be seen to perform a mating display of rising at speed in a vertical climb in clear air, before stalling and dropping into a powered dive, then repeating.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-DOC-10) Much of this behaviour is more notable during the breeding season of early spring—September and October. Females alone build nests of twigs, grasses and mosses.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-DOC-10)

### Feeding

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Tui_Eating_Phormium_Tenax.JPG/220px-Tui_Eating_Phormium_Tenax.JPG)

Feeding on flax nectar

[Nectar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar "Nectar") is the normal diet but fruit and insects are frequently eaten, and [pollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen "Pollen") and seeds more occasionally. Particularly popular is the [New Zealand flax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_flax "New Zealand flax"), whose nectar sometimes [ferments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(food) "Fermentation (food)"), resulting in the tui flying in a fashion that suggests that they might be drunk. They are the main [pollinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollinator "Pollinator") of [flax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phormium "Phormium"), [kowhai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowhai "Kowhai"), [kaka beak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaka_beak "Kaka beak") and some other plants. Note that the flowers of the three plants mentioned are similar in shape to the tui's beak—a vivid example of [mutualistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology) "Mutualism (biology)") [coevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coevolution "Coevolution").[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-11)

### Songs and calls

Feathers fluffed up and loudly crying

![File:Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae vocalizations.ogv](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Prosthemadera_novaeseelandiae_vocalizations.ogv/220px--Prosthemadera_novaeseelandiae_vocalizations.ogv.jpg)

This short video includes vocalizations.

Tui have complex variety of songs and calls, much like [parrots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot "Parrot").[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-12) They also resemble parrots in their ability to clearly imitate human speech,[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-13) and were trained by Māori to replicate complex speech.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-14) Tui are also known for their noisy, unusual call, different for each individual, that combine [bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird "New Zealand bellbird")\-like notes with clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks and groans, and wheezing sounds. Songbirds have two voice boxes (syrinxes) [\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-15) and this is what enables them to perform such a myriad of [vocalisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vocalization "Bird vocalization"). Tui song also exhibits geographical, microgeographic, seasonal, sex and individual variation.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-16)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-18)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-19)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-20)

Some of the wide range of tui sounds are beyond the [human register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hearing "Human hearing"). Watching a tui sing, one can observe gaps in the sound when the beak is agape and throat tufts throbbing. However, ongoing research has so far failed to detect [ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound "Ultrasound") within tui vocalisations.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Tui will also sing at night, especially around the full moon period.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)#cite_note-21)

Mikhail Mishustin was born on 3 March 1966 in [Lobnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobnya "Lobnya"), a town close to [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow"), or in Moscow itself, to the Mishustin family, Vladimir Moiseyevich and Luiza Mikhailovna.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-DW.COM-6) Mishustin's paternal grand-father was partially of [Russian Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Jewish "Russian Jewish") origin[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-er-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-gs-8) and his mother is an ethnic [Armenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians "Armenians"), with roots in the village of Meghradzor, Kotayk Province, Armenia.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-10)

In 1989, he graduated from the [STANKIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STANKIN "STANKIN"), majoring in system engineering, and then in 1992, he completed postgraduate studies at the same Institute.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-11)

After finishing graduate school, he began working as a director of a test laboratory facility.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-mkf1-12) In 1992, Mishustin began working at the International Computer Club (ICC),[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-13) a public non-profit organization,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-mkf1-12) where he worked on facilitating the integration of Russian and Western advanced information technologies.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-13) He ultimately headed the board of the International Computer Club.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-mkf1-12)

In 1998, he joined the state service as an assistant for information systems for accounting and control over the receipt of tax payments to the head of the State tax service of the Russian Federation.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-13) From 1998 to 2004, he worked as Deputy tax minister, being second-in-command at the State Tax Service.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-RudnitskyPismennaya1-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-15) He worked as head of the Federal Agency for Real Estate Cadastre[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-13) within the [Russian Ministry of Economic Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economic_Development_of_the_Russian_Federation "Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation"), and head of the Federal Agency for Managing Special Economic Zones.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-nalog.ru-16)

In 2008, Mishustin left the civil service and returned to the private sector. He spent two years as the president of UFG Asset Management, an investment fund, before resigning to become head of the Federal Tax Service.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-RudnitskyPismennaya1-14)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-13)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-17)

In February 2009, he joined the personnel reserve of the President of Russia.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-18)

## Head of the Federal Tax Service

In 2010, Mishustin was appointed head of the [Federal Tax Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tax_Service_(Russia) "Federal Tax Service (Russia)") (FTS). After his appointment to this post, entrepreneurs expressed the hope that Mishustin, as coming from business, would be more "friendly" to Russian entrepreneurs.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-19) As head of the Federal Tax Service, Mishustin earned a reputation as a skilled [technocrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy "Technocracy")[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-ftwhois-20)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-wedwiki-21) and emphasized tax simplification and electronic tax services.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-22) During this period, however, the tax service was criticized for its overly strict approach to business; Mishustin rejected this criticism, pointing to a decrease in the number of on-site tax audits and tax inspections of large and medium-sized businesses.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-23)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-24)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-25)

As head of the FTS, Mishustin declared war on "dirty data" and targeted problems with unjustified [value-added tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax "Value-added tax") (VAT) refunds.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-autogenerated3-26)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-27) Mishustin emphasized digitization and [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data "Big data"),[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-28) making extensive use of "[techno-authoritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT-backed_authoritarianism "IT-backed authoritarianism")" systems of [government surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_surveillance "Government surveillance") of economic activity, including the collection of data on almost every transaction in Russia.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Sullivan2020-29) This data collection was facilitated by new legislation that required all business-to-business invoices to be submitted to the government and required all retailers to automatically transmit real-time transaction data to tax authorities through an "online cash register" process.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Sullivan2020-29) The government used [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") to identify persons suspected of [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion "Tax evasion").[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Sullivan2020-29) This system of surveillance resulted in a decrease in the share of VAT uncollected by Russian authorities during Mishustin's tenure; the "VAT gap" reportedly declined from 20% to less than 1%).[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Sullivan2020-29)

Mishustin at his confirmation hearing at the [State Duma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma "State Duma") on 16 January 2020

Prime Minister [Dmitry Medvedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev "Dmitry Medvedev"), along with his entire Cabinet, resigned on 15 January 2020, after [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia "President of Russia") [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin") delivered the [Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Presidential_Address_to_the_Federal_Assembly "2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly"), in which he proposed several amendments to the constitution. Medvedev stated that he was resigning to allow Putin to make the significant constitutional changes suggested by Putin regarding shifting power away from the presidency.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Reuters_resign_2020-30) Putin accepted the resignation. However, on Putin's instructions, the Cabinet continued its work as a caretaker cabinet until the formation of a new government.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-32)[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-33)

On 15 January 2020, Putin nominated Mishustin for the post of Prime Minister.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-NewPM-1) The next day, he was confirmed by the State Duma to the post[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-34)[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-35) and appointed Prime Minister by Putin's decree.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-36) This was the first time ever that a PM was confirmed without any votes against.

First meeting of the Mishustin's Cabinet on 21 January 2020

On 21 January 2020, Mishustin presented to President Vladimir Putin a draft structure of his Cabinet. On the same day, the President signed a decree on the structure of the Cabinet and appointed the proposed Ministers.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-37)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-38)[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-39)

In general, the government has been updated by half. Only four Deputy Prime Ministers remained from [Medvedev's Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev%27s_Second_Cabinet "Dmitry Medvedev's Second Cabinet") (three retained their seats, one was appointed to another post) and twelve Ministers.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-40)

According to many political analysts, Mikhail Mishustin was the only Putin's Prime Minister who formed a truly "own" Cabinet. He gathered a team of his own people and associates. Before that, in the XXI century, only Vladimir Putin was able to do this. In particular, two Deputy Prime Ministers were deputies of Mishustin in the Federal Tax Service. According to experts, this means that Mishustin has carte blanche for changes.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-42)

Mikhail Mishustin was born on 3 March 1966 in [Lobnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobnya "Lobnya"), a town close to [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow"), or in Moscow itself,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-DW.COM-6) to the Mishustin family, Vladimir Moiseyevich and Luiza Mikhailovna. His mother was born in the city of [Kotlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlas "Kotlas") in the [Arkhangelsk region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkhangelsk_Oblast "Arkhangelsk Oblast").[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Komsomolskaya_Pravda-7) Mishustin's father, born in [Polotsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polotsk "Polotsk"), [Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus "Belarus"),[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Komsomolskaya_Pravda-7) was reportedly of [Belarusian Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Belarus "History of the Jews in Belarus") origin.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-er-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-9)

In 1989, he graduated from the [STANKIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STANKIN "STANKIN"), majoring in system engineering, and then in 1992, he completed postgraduate studies at the same Institute.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-10)

After finishing graduate school, he began working as a director of a test laboratory facility.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-mkf1-11) In 1992, Mishustin began working at the International Computer Club (ICC),[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-12) where he worked on facilitating the integration of Russian and Western information technologies.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-12) He ultimately headed the board of the International Computer Club.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-mkf1-11)

In 1998, he joined the state service as an assistant for information systems for accounting and control over the receipt of tax payments to the head of the State tax service of the Russian Federation.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-12) From 1998 to 2004, he worked as Deputy tax minister, being second-in-command at the State Tax Service.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-RudnitskyPismennaya1-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-14) He worked as head of the Federal Agency for Real Estate Cadastre[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-12) within the [Russian Ministry of Economic Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economic_Development_of_the_Russian_Federation "Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation"), and head of the Federal Agency for Managing Special Economic Zones.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-nalog.ru-15)

In 2008, Mishustin left the civil service and returned to the private sector. He spent two years as the president of UFG Asset Management, an investment fund, before resigning to become head of the Federal Tax Service.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-RudnitskyPismennaya1-13)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-12)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-16)

## Head of the Federal Tax Service

In 2010, Mishustin was appointed head of the [Federal Tax Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tax_Service_(Russia) "Federal Tax Service (Russia)") (FTS). After his appointment to this post, entrepreneurs expressed the hope that Mishustin, as coming from business, would be more "friendly" to Russian entrepreneurs.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-18) As head of the Federal Tax Service, Mishustin earned a reputation as a skilled [technocrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy "Technocracy")[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-ftwhois-19)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-wedwiki-20) and emphasized tax simplification and electronic tax services.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-21) During this period, however, the tax service was criticized for its overly strict approach to business; Mishustin rejected this criticism, pointing to a decrease in the number of on-site tax audits and tax inspections of large and medium-sized businesses.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-22)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-23)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-24)

As head of the FTS, Mishustin declared war on "dirty data" and targeted problems with unjustified [value-added tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax "Value-added tax") (VAT) refunds.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-autogenerated3-25)[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-26) Mishustin emphasized digitization and [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data "Big data"),[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-27) making extensive use of "[techno-authoritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT-backed_authoritarianism "IT-backed authoritarianism")" systems of [government surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_surveillance "Government surveillance") of economic activity, including the collection of data on almost every transaction in Russia.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Sullivan2020-28) This data collection was facilitated by new legislation that required all business-to-business invoices to be submitted to the government and required all retailers to automatically transmit real-time transaction data to tax authorities through an "online cash register" process.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Sullivan2020-28) The government used [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") to identify persons suspected of [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion "Tax evasion").[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Sullivan2020-28) This system of surveillance resulted in a decrease in the share of VAT uncollected by Russian authorities during Mishustin's tenure; the "VAT gap" reportedly declined from 20% to less than 1%).[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Sullivan2020-28)

Mishustin at his confirmation hearing at the [State Duma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma "State Duma") on 16 January 2020

Prime Minister [Dmitry Medvedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev "Dmitry Medvedev"), along with his entire Cabinet, resigned on 15 January 2020, after [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia "President of Russia") [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin") delivered the [Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Presidential_Address_to_the_Federal_Assembly "2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly"), in which he proposed several amendments to the constitution. Medvedev stated that he was resigning to allow Putin to make the significant constitutional changes suggested by Putin regarding shifting power away from the presidency.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Reuters_resign_2020-29) Putin accepted the resignation. However, on Putin's instructions, the Cabinet continued its work as a caretaker cabinet until the formation of a new government.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-30)[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-32)

On 15 January 2020, Putin nominated Mishustin for the post of Prime Minister.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-NewPM-1) According to Putin, he was offered four candidates, but Mishustin was not among them. As a result, Putin independently decided to nominate Mishustin for the Prime Minister.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-33) The next day, he was confirmed by the State Duma to the post[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-34)[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-35) and appointed Prime Minister by Putin's decree.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-36) This was the first time ever that a PM was confirmed without any votes against.

First meeting of the Mishustin's Cabinet on 21 January 2020

On 21 January 2020, Mishustin presented to President Vladimir Putin a draft structure of his Cabinet. On the same day, the President signed a decree on the structure of the Cabinet and appointed the proposed Ministers.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-37)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-38)[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-39)

Mishustin's meeting with Prime Minister of Slovakia [Peter Pellegrini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pellegrini "Peter Pellegrini") on 26 February 2020

In general, the government has been updated by half. Only four Deputy Prime Ministers remained from [Medvedev's Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev%27s_Second_Cabinet "Dmitry Medvedev's Second Cabinet") (three retained their seats, one was appointed to another post) and twelve Ministers.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-40)

According to many political analysts, Mikhail Mishustin is the only one of Putin's Prime Ministers who truly formed his "own" Cabinet. He gathered a team of his own people and associates. Before that, in the XXI century, only Vladimir Putin was able to do this. In particular, two Deputy Prime Ministers were deputies of Mishustin in the Federal Tax Service. According to experts, this means that Mishustin has carte blanche for changes.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-42)

On 26 March 2020, Mishustin proposed to restore the Government's Presidium, a body in the structure of the Cabinet formed to solve operational issues. Previously, such a body existed in the first Government of Medvedev, but in the second Government of Medvedev there was no Presidium.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-43)

### Term

Mishustin cut the Federal budget for 2020–2022, in correspondence to the [2020 Presidential Address to the Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Presidential_Address_to_the_Federal_Assembly "2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly"). Mishustin engaged in the digital economy and promised support to large companies. He also suggested creating a common electronic income database for Russians, where all citizens incomes will be tracked.

Since February 2020, Mishustin has started traveling around the country to make a real assessment of living conditions in various regions and identify issues on which it is necessary to strengthen work.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-44) Before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Mishustin managed to visit four regions: [Novgorod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novgorod_Oblast "Novgorod Oblast"), [Kurgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan_Oblast "Kurgan Oblast"), [Yaroslavl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslavl_Oblast "Yaroslavl Oblast") and [Kostroma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostroma_Oblast "Kostroma Oblast") oblasts.

On 30 January he signed an order to close the borders with [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") in the [Russian Far East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Far_East "Russian Far East").[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-46) On 18 February Mishustin signed an order banning Chinese citizens from entering Russia. The ban has been in effect since 20 February.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-47)

On 14 March Mishustin created a Coordinating council for the fight against coronavirus, which he personally headed.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-48) The next day, by presidential decree, a working group of the [State Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_(Russia) "State Council (Russia)") was created, headed by Moscow Mayor [Sergey Sobyanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Sobyanin "Sergey Sobyanin"). However, according to [Dmitry Peskov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov "Dmitry Peskov"), Mishustin's Coordinating Council is more important than Sobyanin's Working Group.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-49)

Since 16 March, flights to and from the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Norway "2020 coronavirus pandemic in Norway") and [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Switzerland "2020 coronavirus pandemic in Switzerland") are limited to regular flights between capital cities ([Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva "Geneva") in case of Switzerland) and [Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Sheremetyevo_Airport "Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport"), and charter flights.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-50) Mikhail Mishustin announced that [the border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus%E2%80%93Russia_border "Belarus–Russia border") with [Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus "Belarus") has been closed for the movement of people, for which he was criticized by Belarusian President [Alexander Lukashenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko "Alexander Lukashenko"), and an entry ban for foreigners will be imposed from 18 March to 1 May.[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-51)[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-52) In addition, borders with other countries bordering Russia were also closed.[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-53)

On 18 and 19 March Mishustin announced measures to support business. In particular, he instructed to defer the payment of taxes for travel agencies and airlines, as well as to defer insurance premiums for small businesses.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-54)[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-55)

On 19 March Mishustin announced the government's control over food and drug prices due to the coronavirus. It also temporarily lifted all restrictions on the supply of essential goods.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-56)

On 20 March Mishustin instructed to restrict flights to the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") and [United Arabic Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arabic_Emirates "United Arabic Emirates").[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-57) On the same day, Mishustin announced that six drugs for coronavirus had been developed in Russia and were being tested.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-58)

On 27 March, as a follow-up to Putin's address to the nation, Mishustin ordered all reservations at [pensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_(lodging) "Pension (lodging)") or [holiday houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_cottage "Holiday cottage") to be cancelled from 28 March to 1 June, recommended regional authorities to close all the [pistes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piste "Piste") at resorts for the same period, instructed them to force all the public eating places (except for delivery services) to suspend activities from 28 March to 5 April, and recommend the citizens to refrain from travelling.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-59)

On 30 March, as Moscow and Moscow Oblast declared a lockdown, Mishustin urged all regions to follow the example and take similar measures. He also announced a bill that would raise fines for breaching quarantine requirements.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-60)[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-61)

On 1 April, Mishustin and the [Minister of Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Digital_Development,_Communications_and_Mass_Media_(Russia) "Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media (Russia)") [Maxut Shadayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxut_Shadayev "Maxut Shadayev") announced creating a system of tracking quarantine violation based on data of [mobile network operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_network_operators_of_Europe#Russia "List of mobile network operators of Europe").

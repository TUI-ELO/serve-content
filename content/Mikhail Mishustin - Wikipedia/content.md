Mikhail Mishustin was born on 3 March 1966 in [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow") to the Mishustin family, Vladimir Moiseevich and Luiza Mikhailovna.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-DW.COM-3) In 1989, he graduated from the [STANKIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STANKIN "STANKIN"), majoring in system engineering, and then in 1992, he completed postgraduate studies at the same Institute.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-4)

After finishing graduate school, he began working as a director of a test laboratory.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-mkf1-5) In 1992, Mishustin began working at the International Computer Club (ICC),[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-6) a public non-profit organization,[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-mkf1-5) where he worked on facilitating the integration of Russian and Western advanced information technologies.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-6) He ultimately headed the board of the International Computer Club.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-mkf1-5)

In 1998, he joined the state service as an assistant for information systems for accounting and control over the receipt of tax payments to the head of the State tax service of the Russian Federation.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-6) From 1998 to 2004 he worked as Deputy tax minister, being second-in-command at the State Tax Service.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-RudnitskyPismennaya1-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-8) He worked as head of the Federal Agency for Real Estate Cadastre[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-6) within the [Russian Ministry of Economic Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economic_Development_of_the_Russian_Federation "Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation"), and head of the Federal Agency for Managing Special Economic Zones.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-nalog.ru-9)

In 2008, he left the civil service on his own and returned to business — this time in the field of investment. That year, he began what would ultimately be a two year tenure as the president of UFG Asset Management, later resigning to serve as head of the Federal Tax Service.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-RudnitskyPismennaya1-7)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Anadolu-6)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-10)

In February 2009, he joined the personnel reserve of the President of Russia.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-11)

## Head of the Federal Tax Service

In 2010, Mikhail Mishustin was appointed head of the [Federal Tax Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tax_Service_(Russia) "Federal Tax Service (Russia)"). In this position, he declared war on "dirty data" and began to root out problems with unjustified VAT refunds.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-autogenerated3-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-13)

After his appointment for this post entrepreneurs expressed the hope that Mishustin, as coming from business, would be more "friendly" to Russian entrepreneurs. Mishustin supported the simplification of interaction between businesses and citizens with tax authorities. For the convenience of people's work and the fight against corruption, Mishustin said that he intended to develop electronic services in the Federal tax service as much as possible.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-15)

In addition to Informatization, the Federal tax service under Mishustin's leadership worked on new standards for servicing taxpayers. In particular, for the convenience of citizens, the opening hours of inspections have been extended. In 2015, the Federal contact centre started working.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-16)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-17)

During this period, the tax service was criticized for its overly strict approach to business, and Mishustin rejected this accusation, citing a significant reduction in the number of inspections. So, with the arrival of Mishustin in 2010, the Federal tax service changed its approach to the organisation of control events, focusing on analytical work. As a result, the number of on-site tax audits has sharply decreased, while their efficiency has increased. If earlier every tenth taxpayer was checked, in 2018, the tax authorities checked only one small business company out of 4,000. The number of inspections of large and medium-sized businesses has also decreased significantly.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-18)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-19)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-20)

As head of the Federal Tax Service, Mishustin earned a reputation as a skilled [technocrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy "Technocracy").[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-ftwhois-21)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-wedwiki-22)

PM [Dmitry Medvedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev "Dmitry Medvedev"), along with his entire Cabinet resigned on 15 January 2020, after [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia "President of Russia") [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin") delivered the [Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Presidential_Address_to_the_Federal_Assembly "2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly"), in which he proposed several amendments to the constitution. Medvedev stated that he was resigning to allow President Putin to make the significant constitutional changes suggested by Putin regarding shifting power away from the presidency.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-Reuters_resign_2020-23) Putin accepted the resignation. However, on Putin's instructions, the Cabinet continued its work as a caretaker cabinet until the formation of a new government.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-24)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-25)[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-26)

On 15 January 2020, President [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin") nominated Mikhail Mishustin for the post of Prime Minister.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-NewPM-1) On 16 January, Mikhail Mishustin was confirmed by the State Duma as Prime Minister. For the first time in history, no MP voted against it.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-27)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-28) On the same day, he was appointed Prime Minister by President Putin's decree.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Mishustin#cite_note-29)

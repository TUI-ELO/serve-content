_**Saturday Night Live**_ (known simply as _**SNL**_) is an American late-night live television [sketch comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy "Sketch comedy") and [variety show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show "Variety show"). Created by [Lorne Michaels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne_Michaels "Lorne Michaels") and developed by [Dick Ebersol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Ebersol "Dick Ebersol"). The show premiered on [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC "NBC") on October 11, 1975, under the original title _**NBC's Saturday Night**_. The show's [comedy sketches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_Saturday_Night_Live_characters_and_sketches_(listed_alphabetically) "Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches (listed alphabetically)"), which often parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a [large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_cast_members "Saturday Night Live cast members"). Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening [monologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue "Monologue") and performs in sketches with the cast as with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a [cold open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_open "Cold open") sketch that ends with someone [breaking character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_character "Breaking character") and proclaiming, "[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_from_New_York,_it%27s_Saturday_Night! "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!")", properly beginning the show.

In 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by [Jean Doumanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Doumanian "Jean Doumanian"), who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985. Since Michaels' return he has held the job of show-runner. Many _SNL_ cast members have found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, and starring in television and film.

Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC's headquarters in the Comcast Building at [30 Rockefeller Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rockefeller_Plaza "30 Rockefeller Plaza"), _SNL_ has aired 881 episodes since its debut, and began its [forty-fifth season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_45) "Saturday Night Live (season 45)") on September 28, 2019, making it one of the [longest-running network television programs in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-running_United_States_television_series "List of longest-running United States television series"). The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films including _[The Blues Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(film) "The Blues Brothers (film)")_ (1980) and _[Wayne's World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_(film) "Wayne's World (film)")_ (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including [home media releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_DVD_releases "List of Saturday Night Live DVD releases") of "best of" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.

Throughout four decades on air, _Saturday Night Live_ has received a number of awards, including 71 [Primetime Emmy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award "Primetime Emmy Award"),[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-GD-1) four [Writers Guild of America Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America_Award "Writers Guild of America Award"),[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-writersguildsnl-2) and two [Peabody Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Award "Peabody Award").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-peabodywinnersbooksnl-3) In 2000, it was inducted into the [National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Broadcasters_Hall_of_Fame "National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame"). It was ranked tenth in _[TV Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide "TV Guide")_'s "[50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide%27s_50_Greatest_TV_Shows_of_All_Time "TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time")" list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of _[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_ magazine's "100 Best TV Shows of All-_TIME._" As of 2018, the show had received 252 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, the most received by any television program.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-4) The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests.

## Development

**History of _Saturday Night Live_** series:

From 1965 until September 1975, NBC ran _[The Best of Carson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson")_ reruns of _The Tonight Show_, airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates' discretion (originally known as _The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_). In 1974, [Johnny Carson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Carson "Johnny Carson") announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so they could be aired during weeknights, allowing him to take time off.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-5)

In 1974, NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming, [Dick Ebersol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Ebersol "Dick Ebersol"), and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] At the suggestion of [Paramount Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures") executive [Barry Diller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Diller "Barry Diller"), Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels. Over the next three weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter's idea for a variety show featuring [high-concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-concept "High-concept") comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances that would attract 18- to 34-year-old viewers.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-History2-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHammill20042008-7) By 1975, Michaels had assembled a talented cast, including [Dan Aykroyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Aykroyd "Dan Aykroyd"), [John Belushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Belushi "John Belushi"), [Chevy Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevy_Chase "Chevy Chase"), [Jane Curtin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Curtin "Jane Curtin"), [Garrett Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Morris "Garrett Morris"), [Laraine Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laraine_Newman "Laraine Newman"), [Michael O'Donoghue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_O%27Donoghue "Michael O'Donoghue"), [Gilda Radner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilda_Radner "Gilda Radner"),[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-History2-6) and [George Coe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coe "George Coe").[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-LFNYch1-8) The show was originally called _NBC's Saturday Night_, because _Saturday Night Live_ was in use by _[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_with_Howard_Cosell "Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell")_ on the rival network [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-OriginalTitle-9) After the cancellation of the Cosell show, NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26, 1977.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-10) The show was originally conceived with three rotating permanent hosts: [Lily Tomlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Tomlin "Lily Tomlin"), [Richard Pryor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pryor "Richard Pryor"), and [George Carlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin "George Carlin"). When Pryor dropped out because his brand of comedy was not censor-friendly, the concept was dropped. [\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTETropiano20132-11)

Debuting on October 11, 1975,[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHammill20042008-7) the show quickly developed a [cult following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following "Cult following"),[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHillWeingrad1986105-12) eventually becoming a mainstream hit and spawning (in 1978) "Best of _Saturday Night Live_" compilations that reached viewers who could not stay awake for the live broadcasts. But during the first season in 1975 and 1976, according to a book about the show authored by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad, some NBC executives were not satisfied with the show's Nielsen ratings and shares.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHillWeingrad1986179-13) Lorne Michaels pointed out to them that Nielsen's measurement of demographics indicated that baby boomers constituted a large majority of the viewers who did commit to watching the show, and many of them watched little else on television.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHillWeingrad1986180-14) In 1975 and 1976, they were the most desirable demographic for television advertisers, even though [Generation X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X "Generation X") was the right age for commercials for toys and other children's products. Baby boomers far outnumbered Generation X in reality but not in television viewership with the exception of Michaels's new show and major league sports, and advertisers had long been concerned about baby boomers' distaste for the powerful medium. NBC executives eventually understood Michaels's explanation of the desirable demographics and they decided to keep the show on the air despite many angry letters and phone calls that the network received from viewers who were offended by certain sketches.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHillWeingrad1986187-15)

They included a Weekend Update segment on April 24, 1976, the 18th episode, that ridiculed Aspen, Colorado murder suspect [Claudine Longet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudine_Longet "Claudine Longet") and warranted an on-air apology by announcer [Don Pardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Pardo "Don Pardo") during the following episode.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHillWeingrad1986207-16) Herminio Traviesas, a censor who was vice president of the network's Standards and Practices department, objected to cast member Laraine Newman's use of the term "pissed off" in the March 13, 1976, episode with host [Anthony Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Perkins "Anthony Perkins"), according to the book by Hill and Weingrad, and was in the process of placing the show on a permanent delay of several seconds, instead of live, but he changed his mind after Newman personally apologized to him.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHillWeingrad1986239-17)

Chevy Chase left the show in November of the second season and was replaced a few months later by the then-unknown comic actor [Bill Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Murray "Bill Murray"). Aykroyd and Belushi left the show in 1979 after the end of season four. In May 1980 (after season five), Michaels—emotionally and physically exhausted—requested to put the show on hiatus for a year to give him time and energy to pursue other projects.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002121%E2%80%93122-18) Concerned that the show would be canceled without him, Michaels suggested writers [Al Franken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken "Al Franken"), [Tom Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Davis_(comedian) "Tom Davis (comedian)"), and [Jim Downey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Downey_(comedian) "Jim Downey (comedian)") as his replacements. NBC president [Fred Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Silverman "Fred Silverman") disliked Franken and was infuriated by Franken's Weekend Update routine called "[A Limo For A Lame-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Limo_For_A_Lame-O "A Limo For A Lame-O")", a scathing critique of Silverman's job performance at the network and his insistence on traveling by limousine at the network's expense. Silverman blamed Michaels for approving this Weekend Update segment.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002157%E2%80%93159,_161-19) Unable to get the deal he wanted, Michaels chose to leave NBC for Paramount Pictures, intending to take his associate producer, [Jean Doumanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Doumanian "Jean Doumanian"), with him. Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position at _SNL_ after being recommended by her friend, NBC vice president Barbara Gallagher.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002160%E2%80%93161-20) Michaels's departure led to most of the cast and writing staff leaving the show.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002167-21)

The reputation of the show as a springboard to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series. Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less than three months, and NBC immediately cut the show's budget from the previous $1  million per episode down to just $350,000. Doumanian faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff, particularly males who did not appreciate a woman believing she could take Michaels's place.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002166,_176-22) The season was a disaster; ratings plummeted, and audiences failed to connect to the original cast's replacements, such as [Charles Rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Rocket "Charles Rocket") and [Ann Risley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Risley "Ann Risley").[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002167-21) Doumanian's fate was sealed when, during a sketch, Rocket said "fuck" on live television.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002175-23) After only ten months, Doumanian was dismissed.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002130-24)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CrewDoumanian-25) Although executives suggested that _SNL_ be left to die, network chief [Brandon Tartikoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Tartikoff "Brandon Tartikoff") wanted to keep the show on the air, believing that the concept was more important to the network than money. Tartikoff turned to Ebersol as his choice for the new producer. Ebersol previously had been fired by Silverman. Ebersol gained Michaels's approval in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian's tenure.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002177%E2%80%93179-26)

Ebersol's tenure saw commercial success, but was considered lackluster compared to the Michaels era, except for the breakout of new cast member [Eddie Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy "Eddie Murphy") during the 1980–81 sixth season.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002155-27) Murphy, the main draw of the cast, left in 1984 to pursue his already successful film career, and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast. He broke with history by hiring established comedians such as [Billy Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Crystal "Billy Crystal") and [Martin Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Short "Martin Short") who could bring their already successful material to the show.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002177%E2%80%93179-26) Ebersol's final year with this new cast is considered one of the series' funniest, but had strayed far from the precedent-shattering show Michaels had created.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002197-28) After that season, Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp, including departing from the show's established "live" format.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Following unsuccessful forays into film and television, in need of money, and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show,[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002200-29) Michaels finally returned in 1985 after Ebersol opted out. The show was again recast, with Michaels borrowing Ebersol's idea to seek out established actors such as [Joan Cusack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Cusack "Joan Cusack") and [Robert Downey Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr. "Robert Downey Jr.")[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002199-30) The cast and writers struggled creatively, and in April 1986, Tartikoff made the decision to cancel the show, until he was convinced by producer [Bernie Brillstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Brillstein "Bernie Brillstein") to give it one more year.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002211-31) The show was renewed but for the first time in its history, for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty-two.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002212-32) Michaels again fired most of the cast and, learning his lesson from the previous seasons, sought out unknown talent such as [Dana Carvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Carvey "Dana Carvey") and [Phil Hartman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Hartman "Phil Hartman") instead of known names.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002212-32)

The show ran successfully again until it lost Carvey and Hartman, two of its biggest stars, between 1992 and 1994. Wanting to increase _SNL_'s ratings and profitability, then-NBC West Coast president [Don Ohlmeyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Ohlmeyer "Don Ohlmeyer") and other executives began to actively interfere in the show, recommending that new stars such as [Chris Farley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Farley "Chris Farley") and [Adam Sandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sandler "Adam Sandler") be fired because Ohlmeyer did not "get" them, and critiquing the costly nature of performing the show live. The show faced increasing criticism from the press and cast, in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping to weaken Michaels's position.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002352%E2%80%93353,_358-33) Michaels received a lucrative offer to develop a Saturday night project for [CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") during this time, but remained loyal to _SNL_.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002350%E2%80%93351-34) By 1995, Farley and Sandler were fired, and [Mike Myers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Myers "Mike Myers"), another popular cast member, had left for a film career, but a new cast featuring [Will Ferrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell "Will Ferrell"), [Jimmy Fallon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Fallon "Jimmy Fallon"), and [Tina Fey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey "Tina Fey") proved promising.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002359-35) The show focused on performers, and writers were forced to supply material for the cast's existing characters before they could write original sketches.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002361%E2%80%93362-36) By 1997, Ohlmeyer renewed his focus on limiting Michaels's independence, forcing the removal of writer Jim Downey and cast member [Norm Macdonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Macdonald "Norm Macdonald").[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002363-37)

## Cast and crew

### Cast

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/SNL_Original_Cast.jpg/220px-SNL_Original_Cast.jpg)

The original 1975 cast of _SNL_, titled "The Not Ready For Prime-Time Players,"[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarxSienkiewiczBecker20136-38)[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastPTime-39) a term coined by writer [Herb Sargent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Sargent "Herb Sargent"),[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200238-40) included Laraine Newman, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris, and Chevy Chase. Radner was the first person hired after Michaels himself. Although Chase became a performer, he was hired on a one-year writer contract and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him, allowing him to leave the show after the first season in 1976.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200223-41) Newman was brought aboard after having a prior working relationship with Michaels.[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200227-42) Morris was initially brought in as a writer, but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels to have Morris audition for the cast, where he turned in a successful performance.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200228-43) Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast members hired.[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200227-42) Belushi had a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear on other shows, but decided to work with the show because of the involvement of Radner, and writers [Anne Beatts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Beatts "Anne Beatts") and [Michael O'Donoghue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_O%27Donoghue "Michael O'Donoghue").[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200226-44) Michaels was still reluctant to hire Belushi, believing he would be a source of trouble for the show, but Beatts, O'Donoghue, and Ebersol successfully argued for his inclusion.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200226-44)

After Chase left the show, he was replaced by Bill Murray, whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first-season cast, but was unable to because of budget restrictions.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200234-45) When Chase returned to host in 1978, he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and his success, particularly Belushi. Murray, goaded by the rest of the cast, and Chase came to blows shortly before the show.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200282%E2%80%9383-46) Chase's departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent; he threatened to fire Aykroyd if he took the role of D-Day in the 1978 comedy _[Animal House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Animal_House "National Lampoon's Animal House")_, and later refused to allow _SNL_ musician [Paul Shaffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Shaffer "Paul Shaffer") to participate in _[The Blues Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(film) "The Blues Brothers (film)")_ (1980) with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 to pursue film careers.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200281-47)[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastHistory-48) Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together in the wake of Chase, Aykroyd, and Belushi's independent successes. Radner had a one-woman [Broadway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre "Broadway theatre") show and Murray starred in the 1979 comedy _[Meatballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatballs_(film) "Meatballs (film)")_.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002118-49) In 1980, Michaels chose to leave the series to pursue other interests and was replaced by Doumanian, who wanted to give the show a fresh start with a new cast and writing staff.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGates2013157%E2%80%93158-50) Michaels was followed by the remaining original cast, Curtin, Newman, Radner, Morris, Murray, and additional cast members.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastHistory-48)

The Doumanian-era cast faced immediate comparison to the beloved former cast and was not received favorably.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002130-24) Ebersol fired the majority of her hires, except for two unknown comedians: [Eddie Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy "Eddie Murphy") and [Joe Piscopo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Piscopo "Joe Piscopo").[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002140-51) Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with him for a role on the show, and after seeing him audition, Levy fought with Doumanian to cast him instead of [Robert Townsend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Townsend_(actor) "Robert Townsend (actor)"). Doumanian wanted only one black cast member and favored Townsend, but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy. Doumanian also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002136%E2%80%93137-52) Even so, Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge,[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002153-53) after which Murphy was credited with much of that era's success.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-Murphy1-54)[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002161%E2%80%93163,_165-55) Murphy's star exploded, and he quickly appeared in films such as _[48 Hrs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/48_Hrs. "48 Hrs.")_ and _[Trading Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_Places "Trading Places")_, before leaving for his film career in early 1984. Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 1983–84 season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material, but at an inflated cost; [Billy Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Crystal "Billy Crystal") and [Martin Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Short "Martin Short") were paid $25,000 and $20,000 per episode, respectively, a far cry from earlier salaries.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002177%E2%80%93179-26) Michaels's return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured established talent such as Robert Downey Jr., [Jon Lovitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lovitz "Jon Lovitz"), and [Dennis Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Miller "Dennis Miller").[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002198-56) The season was poorly received, and another reset followed in 1986. Learning his lesson from the previous season, Michaels avoided known talent in favor of actual ability. He kept Lovitz, Miller, and [Nora Dunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_Dunn "Nora Dunn"), and brought in new, untested talent such as Dana Carvey, [Phil Hartman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Hartman "Phil Hartman"), and [Jan Hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hooks "Jan Hooks"), who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002209-57)

In 1989–90, new talent such as [Mike Myers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Myers "Mike Myers"), [Adam Sandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sandler "Adam Sandler"), and [Chris Farley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Farley "Chris Farley") was added. Afraid of cast members leaving for film careers, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a divide between the veteran members and the new, younger talent, increasing competition for limited screen time.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002308%E2%80%93309,_346%E2%80%93347-58) By 1995, Carvey and Hartman had left, taking with them a virtual army of characters, Myers quit for his movie career, and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley. The show saw its next major overhaul, bringing in a new cast including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Jimmy Fallon.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002352%E2%80%93353,_359-59) While cast members would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest transition in 2013, with the addition of six cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members like [Bill Hader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hader "Bill Hader"), [Jason Sudeikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Sudeikis "Jason Sudeikis"), and [Fred Armisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Armisen "Fred Armisen").[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-2013CastTransition-60)

As of Season 45, _SNL_ has featured 153 cast members including, besides the above-mentioned players, [Rachel Dratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dratch "Rachel Dratch"), [Amy Poehler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Poehler "Amy Poehler"), [Chris Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rock "Chris Rock"), [David Spade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Spade "David Spade"), [Will Forte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte "Will Forte"), [Julia Louis-Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Louis-Dreyfus "Julia Louis-Dreyfus"), [Tracy Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Morgan "Tracy Morgan"), [Chris Parnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Parnell "Chris Parnell"), [Maya Rudolph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Rudolph "Maya Rudolph"), [Andy Samberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Samberg "Andy Samberg"), [Kristen Wiig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Wiig "Kristen Wiig"), and many others. [Kenan Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenan_Thompson "Kenan Thompson") is the show's longest-serving cast member. Thompson first joined the series in [2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_29) "Saturday Night Live (season 29)"), and is currently in his 17th season on the show.[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-61) Those selected to join the cast of _SNL_ are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as [The Groundlings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Groundlings "The Groundlings") (Ferrell, Hartman,[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002219-62) Lovitz, Wiig[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastWiig1-63)) and [The Second City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_City "The Second City") (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey,[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FeySC-64) [Tim Meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Meadows "Tim Meadows")), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, [Norm Macdonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Macdonald "Norm Macdonald")), who already possess the training or experience necessary for _SNL_.[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastCasting-65)

Of the many roles available in the show, one of the longest-running and most coveted is being the host of [Weekend Update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_Update "Weekend Update"), a segment which has alternated between having one or two hosts, and which allows the cast members involved to perform as themselves and be on camera for an extended period of time.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastUpdate1-66) Many of the Weekend Update hosts have gone on to find greater success outside the show, including: Chase, Curtin, Murray,[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastUpdate1-66) Miller, Macdonald,[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002286-67) Fey,[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastUpdate1-66) Fallon,[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002293-68) and Poehler. From 2008, [Seth Meyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Meyers "Seth Meyers") was the solo host of Weekend Update,[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastUpdate1-66) before being partnered with [Cecily Strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecily_Strong "Cecily Strong") in 2013. After Meyers left for _[Late Night with Seth Meyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Night_with_Seth_Meyers "Late Night with Seth Meyers")_ in February 2014, Strong was paired with head writer [Colin Jost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Jost "Colin Jost"). However, later that [year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_40) "Saturday Night Live (season 40)"), she was replaced by writer [Michael Che](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Che "Michael Che").[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-69)[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-70) The cast is divided into two tiers: the more established group of repertory players; and newer, unproven cast members known as featured players, who may eventually be promoted to the repertory stable.

The cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show,[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastContract2-72)[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastContract-73) but starting with the 1999–2000 season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC sitcom. Cast members are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years.[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastContract-73) The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on _SNL_ and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, [Paramount Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures"), and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast, such as Myers and Sandler, gained fame on _SNL_ only to leave and make money for other studios.[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastContract-73) In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported to be contracted to _SNL_ for a total of seven years.[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastContract3-74) The contracts also contain a network option which allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200481-75) In the first season of the show, the cast was paid $750 per episode, rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200278-76) By the late 1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastContract-73) and $5,500 per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 for a cast member in their fifth year. Performers could earn an additional $1,500 per episode for writing a sketch which made it to air.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200481-75) In 2001, Ferrell became the highest-paid cast member, being paid $350,000 per season (approximately $17,500 per episode).[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastContractFerrell-77) In [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_39) "Saturday Night Live (season 39)"), [Sasheer Zamata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasheer_Zamata "Sasheer Zamata") was added as a cast member in mid-season after criticism of the show's lack of an African-American woman.[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-78)[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-79)[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-80)

As of the 2018–19 season, [Michael Che](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Che "Michael Che"), [Colin Jost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Jost "Colin Jost"), and Kent Sublette are the show's co-head writers.[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-81) Jost had been a writer since 2005 and was one of the head writers from 2012 to 2015 before being renamed Head writer. Che has been a writer since 2013. He temporarily left the show in the summer of 2014, but came back that fall to anchor Update and reclaimed his status as a writer.

[Seth Meyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Meyers "Seth Meyers") became a co-head writer in 2005, became the single head writer from 2008 to 2012, and then left in 2014. The Weekend Update segment has its own dedicated team of writers led by head writer and producer Alex Baze as of the 2011–12 season.[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-2013SepCasting-82)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-AlexBaze1-83)[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-WritersAbelesInt1-84) Scenes on Weekend Update that involve members of the cast acting in-character alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside the dedicated Weekend Update team, who know those characters better.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-WritersAbelesInt1-84)

_SNL_ writers are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational comedy. Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings, Second City, [Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upright_Citizens_Brigade_Theatre "Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre"), and [ImprovOlympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IO_Theater "IO Theater").[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-CastHistory-48) Comedian [Jim Downey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Downey_(comedian) "Jim Downey (comedian)") was head writer for nine years beginning in 1985.[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-85) Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the _SNL_ writing room. Like the _SNL_ cast who appear on camera, many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the show, such as [Conan O'Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien "Conan O'Brien"), who was brought into _SNL_ from The Groundlings, went on to write for _[The Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons "The Simpsons")_, and eventually began hosting his own [show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien "Late Night with Conan O'Brien").[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-speakerbio-86) Former head writer [Adam McKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_McKay "Adam McKay"), along with performer Ferrell, founded the successful comedy website [Funny or Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_or_Die "Funny or Die").[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-WriterMcKay-87) In 2000, Tina Fey became the first female _SNL_ head writer[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-Levin2001-88)[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-observer-89) and successfully made the transition to starring on the show,[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-witchel-90) as well as writing and starring in feature films,[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-Otto2004-91)[\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-Ebert2010-92)[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-grosz-93) ultimately creating and starring in her own show _[30 Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock "30 Rock")_, which was partly based on her _SNL_ experiences.[\[94\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-Poniewozik2006-94) In 2005, Fey was paid $1.5 million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer.[\[95\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-WriterHeadSalary-95)

### Announcers

[Don Pardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Pardo "Don Pardo") served as the announcer for the series when it began, and continued in the role for all but season seven between 1981 and 1982, when Michaels had left and [Mel Brandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brandt "Mel Brandt") and [Bill Hanrahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hanrahan "Bill Hanrahan") filled the announcing role. In 2004, Pardo announced that he would step down from his position, but then continued in the role until 2009 where he again announced his retirement, but then continued into the 2009–10 season.[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-Announcer1-96) In 2010, then 92-year-old Pardo was reported to be again considering his retirement, but continued to serve as announcer until his death at age 96 on August 18, 2014, following the 39th season. Apart from a brief period in 2006 in which Pardo pre-recorded his announcements at his home in Arizona, he flew to New York City to perform his announcing duties live.[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-Announcer1-96)[\[97\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-2014Pardo-97) Cast members Joe Piscopo[\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-98) and Darrell Hammond also periodically impersonated Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties when Pardo was unavailable.[\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002295-99) Hammond took over as full-time announcer starting with [season 40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_40) "Saturday Night Live (season 40)").[\[100\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-100)

A typical episode of _SNL_ will feature a single host chosen for their popularity or novelty, or because they have a film, album, or other work being released near the time of their appearance on the show.[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002229-101) The host delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast. Traditionally, the host of the show ends the opening monologue by introducing the musical guest for the night. Comedian [George Carlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin "George Carlin") was the first to host _SNL_ in the debut October 1975 episode;[\[102\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-HostCarlin-102) three episodes later, [Candice Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candice_Bergen "Candice Bergen") became the first female host[\[103\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200244-103) and subsequently the first to host more than once.[\[104\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200248-104) Hosts have been drawn from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, from actors, such as [Christopher Walken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Walken "Christopher Walken"), [Buck Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Henry "Buck Henry"), and [John Goodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Goodman "John Goodman"),[\[105\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002396-105) to musicians like [Dolly Parton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton "Dolly Parton"),[\[106\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002230-106) to political activist [Ralph Nader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader "Ralph Nader").[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002229-101) Guests who have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the [Five-Timers Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-Timers_Club "Five-Timers Club"), a term that originated on a sketch performed on [Tom Hanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks "Tom Hanks")'s fifth episode.[\[107\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-Host5Timer-107) As of February 11, 2017, actor [Alec Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin "Alec Baldwin") holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor [Steve Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin "Steve Martin") who had hosted fifteen times since 1976.[\[108\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-HostBaldwinRec-108) Occasionally, in an effort to boost ratings and/or to maintain the show's budget, former SNL cast members also host; however, [Eddie Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy "Eddie Murphy") is the only person to host the show while still a member of the cast, albeit filling in for [Nick Nolte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Nolte "Nick Nolte").

Each episode also features a musical guest, a solo act or a band, who perform two to three musical numbers. Occasionally, the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host, and may also appear in comedy sketches. As of May 19, 2012, [Dave Grohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl "Dave Grohl") is the most frequent musical guest, performing on eleven shows since 1992.[\[109\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-MusicalGrohl-109) Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using [lip-synching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip-synching "Lip-synching") tracks,[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200245-110) believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show. Exceptions are made only when the musical act is focused on intense dance routines instead of vocals, where it is difficult to be both heavily physically active and sing simultaneously.[\[111\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-60MinutesInterview-111) A 1975 performance by pop group [ABBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA "ABBA") was the first and only act to feature lip-synching,[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200245-110) until [the controversial 2004 performance of Ashlee Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_incidents#Ashlee_Simpson "Saturday Night Live incidents"). Recently, however (particularly in [season 43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_43) "Saturday Night Live (season 43)")), there have been more solo acts than groups. Conversely, for the past seven years, the show has ended its seasons with a solo musical act, while for the past two years the show has begun and ended with a solo host and solo musical guest.

The Saturday Night Live Band (also known as "The Live Band") is the [house band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_band "House band") for _SNL_. Academy Award-winning composer [Howard Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Shore "Howard Shore") served as the first musical director, from 1975 to 1980, appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band and (backing a [U.S. Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Coast_Guard "U.S. Coast Guard") chorus) Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol. Over the years, the band has featured several New York studio musicians including [Paul Shaffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Shaffer "Paul Shaffer") (1975–1980), [Lou Marini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Marini "Lou Marini") (1975–1983), [David Sanborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sanborn "David Sanborn") (1975), [Michael Brecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brecker "Michael Brecker") (early 1980s), [Ray Chew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Chew "Ray Chew") (1980–1983), [Alan Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rubin "Alan Rubin") (1975–1983), [Georg Wadenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wadenius "Georg Wadenius") (1979–1985), [Steve Ferrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ferrone "Steve Ferrone") (1985), [David Johansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Johansen "David Johansen") (performing as Buster Poindexter), [Tom Malone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Malone_(musician) "Tom Malone (musician)") (who took over as musical director from 1981 to 1985), and [G. E. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._E._Smith "G. E. Smith") (musical director from 1985 to 1995). As of 2017, the band is under the leadership of [Tower of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Power "Tower of Power") alumnus [Lenny Pickett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Pickett "Lenny Pickett"), keyboardist [Leon Pendarvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Pendarvis "Leon Pendarvis"), and Eli Brueggemann, who does not play in the band on the live show. The number of musicians has varied over the years, but the basic instrumentation has been three saxophones (alto, tenor, and baritone), one trombone, one trumpet, and a rhythm section featuring two keyboards (piano and Hammond organ), a guitar, bass guitar, drums, and an extra percussionist, not a permanent part of the band until Valerie Naranjo's arrival in 1995. The 1983–1984 and 1984–1985 seasons featured the smallest band, a six-piece combo. The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks; affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a _Saturday Night Live_ bumper graphic until the program resumes.[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-112) The band plays "Closing Theme (Waltz in A)", written by Shore, at the end of the show.[\[113\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-113)

Since the show's inception, _SNL_ has aired from Studio 8H, located on floors8 and9 of the Comcast Building (formerly the [RCA Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_Building "RCA Building") and [GE Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Building "GE Building")) ([30 Rockefeller Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rockefeller_Plaza "30 Rockefeller Plaza") or "30 Rock"). The studio had originally been used as a radio [soundstage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundstage "Soundstage") for [Arturo Toscanini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Toscanini "Arturo Toscanini") and the [NBC Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Symphony_Orchestra "NBC Symphony Orchestra").[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200231-114) Michaels was dumbfounded when he originally inspected Studio 8H in 1975, and found it technically limited, outdated, in need of repair,[\[115\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200230-115) and lacking the capacity to host a live show. Michaels demanded that NBC executives rebuild the studio and improve the acoustics to accommodate the intended musical acts,[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200231-114) at a cost of approximately $300,000.[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200231-114) Three of the first four shows of the 1976–77 season were shot at the former [NBC Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_Studios "JC Studios") in Brooklyn, due to [NBC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News "NBC News") using Studio 8H for [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_United_States_presidential_election "1976 United States presidential election") coverage.[\[116\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-116)

During the summer 2005 shooting hiatus, crews began renovations on Studio 8H. With its thirty-first-season premiere in October 2005, the show began broadcasting in [high-definition television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television "High-definition television"), appearing [letterboxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterbox "Letterbox") on conventional television screens. The offices of _SNL_ writers, producers, and other staff can be found on the 17th floor of "30 Rock."[\[117\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200235-117)

### Creating an episode

Production on an _SNL_ episode will normally start on a Monday with a free-form pitch meeting[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200427-118)[\[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200279-119)[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-SatNightDocu-120) between the cast, writers, producers, including Michaels and the guest host in Michaels's office over two hours. The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting. Although some sketch writing may occur on the day, the bulk of the work revolves around pitching ideas. Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts,[\[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200279-119) a process which usually extends through the night into the following morning. Writing may not begin until 8 p.m. on the Tuesday evening.[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200427-118)[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-SatNightDocu-120) At 5p.m. on Wednesday, the sketches are read by the cast during a round-table meeting in the writers room,[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-SatNightDocu-120) attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting, technical experts such as make-up artists, who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics, and other producers, resulting in an attendance of approximately fifty people.[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200428-121) At this point, there may be at least forty sketch ideas which are read-through in turn, lasting upwards of three hours.[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200428-121)

After completion of the read-through, Michaels, the head writer, the guest host, and some of the show producers will move to Michaels's office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air. Once complete, the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels's office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived.[\[122\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200428%E2%80%9329-122) Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day,[\[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200279-119) but will certainly commence on Thursday. Work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200427-118) and possibly rehearsals.[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-SatNightDocu-120) If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday, it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday[\[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200279-119) before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at 8p.m., again on Saturday before the live show.[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200427-118)[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-SatNightDocu-120) After the rehearsal, Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a 90-minute length, and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed.[\[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200430-123) This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast.[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200427-118) The opening monologue, spoken by the guest host, is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon.[\[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr200423-124)

According to an interview with Fey in 2004, the three- to four-member dedicated Weekend Update writing team will write jokes throughout the week. The host(s) of Weekend Update will normally not work with, or read the scripts from, the team until Thursday evening, after the main show sketches have been finalized. The host(s) will then work on contributing to the script where necessary.[\[125\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-125)[\[126\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-126) As of fall 2017, Weekend Update now has its own separate writing staff dedicated to writing news jokes.

### Post-production

With onsite facilities housed on floors8 and 17 of Rockefeller Plaza, post-production duties on live broadcasts of _Saturday Night Live_ include the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer, coupled with additional audio feeds consisting of music, sound effects, music scoring, and pre-recorded voiceovers. All sources are stored digitally, with shows captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganize for future repeats and syndication. The production tracking system was migrated from primarily [analog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_recording "Analog recording") to [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data "Digital data") in 1998, with live shows typically requiring 1.5 terabytes of storage, consisting of audio elements and five cameras' worth of visual elements.[\[127\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-snlpostprodsan-127) Elements of _Saturday Night Live_ that are pre-recorded, such as certain commercial parodies, [SNL Digital Shorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNL_Digital_Shorts "SNL Digital Shorts"), and show graphics are processed off-site in the post-production facilities of [Broadway Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Video "Broadway Video").[\[128\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-broadreinvent-128)[\[129\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-broadwayvideodotcom-129)

### Filming and photography

Studio 8H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services. Video camera equipment, as of 2014, included four [Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony "Sony") BVP-700 CCD cameras, and two Sony BVP-750 CCD handheld cameras. As of 2018, the show uses five Sony HDC-1500 cameras, primarily mounted on [Vinten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinten "Vinten") [pedestals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestals "Pedestals"), although one is mounted on a Chapman-Leonard Electra crane.[\[130\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-130)[\[131\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-131)[\[132\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-132)

As of 2014, [GVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_Valley_(company) "Grass Valley (company)") 4000-3 digital component production switcher, and GVG 7000 digital component routing switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple digital and analog video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are provided by a [Chyron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chyron_Corporation "Chyron Corporation") Lyric Pro character generator and an [Avid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avid_Technology "Avid Technology") Deko character generator. Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analog mixing console, and a [Yamaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Corporation "Yamaha Corporation") [digital mixing console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mixing_console "Digital mixing console") used for tape playback support and utility audio work.[\[133\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-nbcproduction8h-133) While exact budgets for other seasons are not known, the 39th season (2013–14) had a budget of just over $70 million, for which it received a subsidy from New York State in the amount of $12.3 million.[\[134\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-134)

As of 2009, the opening title sequence and opening montage is shot using the [Canon EOS 5D Mark II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_5D_Mark_II "Canon EOS 5D Mark II") and [Canon EOS 7D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_7D "Canon EOS 7D") digital SLR cameras. Typical elements are recorded at 30 [fps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate "Frame rate"), with slow-motion sequences shot at 60 fps, both in full 1080p high definition.[\[135\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-snlpostprodcanon-135)

Edie Baskin was the original _SNL_ photographer. She was hired after Michaels saw her photographs of [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley "Las Vegas Valley") and other work. Baskin helped create the opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at night.[\[136\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200239-136) The first episode used publicity photos of host George Carlin as transitional [bumpers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_(broadcasting) "Bumper (broadcasting)") between the show and commercial breaks, the second episode used photos Baskin had already taken of host [Paul Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Simon "Paul Simon"). It was then that Michaels suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using publicity photos, beginning a tradition which continues today.[\[137\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller200241-137)

Since 1999, [Mary Ellen Matthews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ellen_Matthews "Mary Ellen Matthews") has been the official photographer of _SNL_, responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited time frame between the host's involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at 30 Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday.[\[138\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-MatthewsInt1-138) Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with [hard lights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_light "Soft light") to achieve a Hollywood style. On the lighting, Matthews commented: "I think it just helps the image pop off the screen... If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional... The \[classic Hollywood lighting\] gives a little more contrast, and if I use edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can."[\[139\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-MatthewsInt2-139) Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos, behind the scenes images, documenting rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved in directing videos, including the show title sequence.[\[139\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-MatthewsInt2-139)

_SNL_'s main stage, during rehearsal, 2008

The show begins at 11:29:30 p.m. [Eastern Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone "Eastern Time Zone"), and is scheduled for a 92-minute timeslot ending at 1:02 a.m.[\[140\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-nbcabout-140)

For most of _SNL'_s history, it aired live only to NBC stations in the Eastern and [Central Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Time_Zone "Central Time Zone") Zones, with all others receiving a recorded broadcast at the normal start time of late-night network programming (11:30 p.m. [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone "Pacific Time Zone") and 10:30 p.m. in other time zones). Since 2017, the show is broadcast live across the contiguous United States. Because the show airs outside of the [safe harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_(broadcasting) "Safe harbor (broadcasting)") outside of Eastern and Central Time, a brief [broadcast delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_delay "Broadcast delay") is installed to meet [Federal Communications Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission "Federal Communications Commission") regulations of primetime programming.[\[141\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-141)

Outside of the contiguous United States, the show also airs live on the three NBC stations in [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska") at 7:30 p.m. local. Two NBC stations still broadcast _SNL_ on tape-delay: [KHNL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHNL "KHNL") in [Honolulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu,_Hawaii "Honolulu, Hawaii") delays it one hour to 7:30 p.m.; and [KUAM-TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUAM-TV "KUAM-TV") in [Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam "Guam"), where the live broadcast occurs at 1:30 p.m. Sunday, delays it to 11 p.m.

Since the first opening in 1975 with Michael O'Donoghue, Chevy Chase, and John Belushi, the show has normally begun with a [cold open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_open "Cold open") sketch which ends with one or more cast members [breaking character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_character "Breaking character") and proclaiming "[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_from_New_York,_it%27s_Saturday_Night! "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!")", segueing into the opening credits which start immediately after.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-LFNYch1-8) From May 1985–April 1991, Saturday Night Live was occasionally preempted for _[Saturday Night's Main Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night%27s_Main_Event "Saturday Night's Main Event")_.

In February 2013, NBC began airing shortened hour-long repeats on Saturday evenings at 10 p.m. Eastern Time during the regular season; the episodes scheduled were sometimes rebroadcasts of the previous week's episode if it was a first-run broadcast.[\[142\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-142) Since the 2014–15 season, the show's 40th anniversary, the prime time rebroadcasts have been a selection of episodes from throughout the show's run under the title _SNL Vintage_.

NBC and Broadway Video both hold the underlying rights to the show, while the copyright to every episode lies either with NBC or [Universal Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Television "Universal Television"). From 1990 until 2004, and again since 2015, [Comedy Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central "Comedy Central") and its predecessor [Ha!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha!_(TV_channel) "Ha! (TV channel)") re-aired reruns of the series, after which [E!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E! "E!") Entertainment Television signed a deal to carry reruns.[\[143\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-143) Abbreviated thirty- and sixty-minute versions of the first five seasons aired as _The Best of Saturday Night Live_ in syndication beginning in the 1980s, and later on [Nick at Nite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_at_Nite "Nick at Nite") in 1988. In September 2010, reruns of most episodes made from 1998 onward began airing on [VH1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1 "VH1").[\[144\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-144) Starting in February 2016, VH1 and Comedy Central's sister channel [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_TV "Logo TV") began airing reruns of the show on Sunday nights, launching its broadcast as counterprogramming for [Super Bowl 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_50 "Super Bowl 50") and branding it the "Live From New York, It's Satur-Gay Night!" marathon. The reruns are mostly from 2006 onward.

On March 16, 2017, NBC announced that it would air the final four episodes of the [42nd season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_42) "Saturday Night Live (season 42)") live in all mainland U.S. time zones for the first time in its history. NBC executive [Robert Greenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Greenblatt "Robert Greenblatt") explained that the show's significant viewership had made it part of the "national conversation", and thus they felt it would be appropriate for the entire country to be "in on the joke at the same time."[\[145\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-tdb-snllive42-145) NBC announced on September 19, 2017, that all the [43rd season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_43) "Saturday Night Live (season 43)")'s episodes will air live coast-to-coast in the U.S.[\[146\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-146)

### Delays

The episode scheduled for October 25, 1986, hosted by [Rosanna Arquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosanna_Arquette "Rosanna Arquette"), was not aired until November8 due to [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_on_NBC "Major League Baseball on NBC") broadcasting Game6 of the [1986 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_World_Series "1986 World Series") between the [New York Mets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets "New York Mets") and [Boston Red Sox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox "Boston Red Sox"); the game entered extra innings, causing that night's broadcast of _SNL_ to be canceled. The show was recorded for the studio audience starting at 1:30 AM Eastern Time, and broadcast two weeks later with an "apology" by Mets pitcher [Ron Darling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Darling "Ron Darling").[\[147\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-147)

The episode scheduled for February 10, 2001, hosted by [Jennifer Lopez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez "Jennifer Lopez"), aired 45 minutes late due to an [XFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFL_(2001) "XFL (2001)") game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay. Michaels was so upset by the delay that the episode was rerun a mere three weeks later. The fledgling football league ended up changing their rules in order to speed up play, and a deal was reached where the feed to future games would be cut off - whether the game had been decided or not - when _SNL_ started, so that no such incident would happen again.[\[148\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-148)

## International versions

Because _SNL_ has been a huge success in the United States, channels in other countries have created their own versions of the show, including in the Middle East and North Africa region, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, and Poland.[\[149\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-jezebel-149)[\[150\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-MTV-150)

A German version of _SNL_ named _RTL Samstag Nacht_ aired between 1993 and 1998 on [RTL Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTL_Television "RTL Television"). Most episodes were hosted by German celebrities, however, some shows were hosted by American personalities who never hosted the American version, including [Mel Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks "Mel Brooks") and [Michael Winslow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Winslow "Michael Winslow"). Due to language barriers, they appeared only in opening monologues and in a limited number of sketches.[\[151\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-151)

_SNL_ in its original American version has aired in [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") since the early 2000s and is broadcast by satellite provider [yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(Israel) "Yes (Israel)"). There was a local SNL-based show named _Am Israel Hai_ (People of Israel Live) back in 2002 but it was canceled after one season. Another SNL-esque Israeli show, _[Eretz Nehederet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eretz_Nehederet "Eretz Nehederet")_ (A Wonderful Country), debuted in 2003 and continues to garner high ratings.

_SNL_ also airs in the Middle East and North Africa, [OSN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSN "OSN") First HD every Saturday night, one week after it airs in the U.S.[\[152\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-152)

In India and Sri Lanka, _Saturday Night Live!_ airs on [Comedy Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central_India "Comedy Central India"), in an hour-long version, one week after the U.S. broadcast.[\[153\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-153)

Spain's version of the show was short-lived, lasting a few episodes which aired on Thursdays and not Saturdays as the title suggested. This version copied heavily from the American version, as they did their own versions of sketches already done on the original series.[\[149\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-jezebel-149) Italy's _Saturday Night Live From Milan_ aired for four seasons and used original material.[\[149\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-jezebel-149)[\[154\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-mediaset1-154)

On December 3, 2011, South Korea's _[SNL Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_Korea "Saturday Night Live Korea")_ premiered on cable channel [tvN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVN_(South_Korea) "TVN (South Korea)").[\[155\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-155)[\[156\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-156)[\[157\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-157)[\[158\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-158) As of July 20, 2013, it is in its fourth consecutive season, with 20 episodes.[\[159\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-159)

The Japanese version _Saturday Night Live JPN_, which ran for six months in 2011, was created in part with Lorne Michaels's production company, [Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company "The Coca-Cola Company"), and Broadway Video and broadcast on [Fuji TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuji_TV "Fuji TV") networks. The show followed the same format with a few minor differences, being only 45 minutes long and hosted by a permanent host. The cast was made up of seasoned comedians who take center stage and newcomers who play the background roles. It was broadcast once a month, and ended after six episodes, as planned from the start.[\[160\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-160)[\[161\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-161)[\[162\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-162)

On May 13, 2014, _SNL Quebec_ was renewed for another eight episodes to be broadcast monthly over the 2014–15 season ending with a "Best of" compilation.[\[164\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-164) Télé-Québec announced in May 2015 that the series would not be renewed due to funding cutbacks,[\[165\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-compressions-165) and [Télévision de Radio-Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision_de_Radio-Canada "Télévision de Radio-Canada") subsequently signed the show's production team and cast to produce a new series, _[Le nouveau show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_nouveau_show "Le nouveau show")_, for that network.[\[166\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-166)

The show received mixed-to-negative reviews.[\[167\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-167)[\[168\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-168)[\[169\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-169)

SNL program items are available from the NBC website and YouTube in the U.S. but are blocked to many overseas (non-U.S.) viewers. Some local television and cable companies outside the U.S. broadcast the show as well, either in live broadcast or as a [VOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand "Video on demand") recording, due to its worldwide reputation\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\].

Twenty cast members have received individual Primetime Emmy Award nominations in the show's history. These nominations were mostly in the category of [Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Individual_Performance_in_a_Variety_or_Music_Program "Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program") before that award was discontinued; since then, nominations have been in the [Supporting Actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Supporting_Actor_in_a_Comedy_Series "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series") and [Supporting Actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Supporting_Actress_in_a_Comedy_Series "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series") categories for comedy series.

### Electoral effect

_SNL_ has also had an effect on American elections—most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called _SNL_ Effect was observed during the [2008 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election "2008 United States presidential election"), according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on _SNL_, with ten percent saying it had made a difference in their decision. [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.[\[180\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-ImpactGeneral-180)

Chevy Chase's bumbling impression of then-president [Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford "Gerald Ford") during the 1976 presidential election was cited as an influence on the election, and a quote commonly attributed to 2008 vice-presidential candidate [Sarah Palin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin "Sarah Palin") stating "I can see Russia from my house" was actually spoken by SNL cast member Tina Fey while portraying Palin.[\[181\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-ImpactPalin-181) Several politicians have appeared on _SNL_, including President [Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford "Gerald Ford") (in 1976, during the show's first season), then-Senator Barack Obama (2007), Senator [John McCain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain "John McCain") (2002 and 2008), Senator Hillary Clinton (2008 and 2015), and Governor Sarah Palin (2008), who appeared alongside Fey's Palin impression, resulting in the show's largest audience in fourteen years with fourteen million viewers.[\[182\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-HostPoliticians-182)[\[183\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-THRPolitical-183) Senator Obama's appearance occurred in part because Hillary Clinton abandoned her scheduled appearance.[\[183\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-THRPolitical-183) The political content was abandoned briefly following the [September 11, 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks"), terrorist attack in New York, with Poehler saying that the writers did not want to produce politicized material; highly political content would be absent for the next four years.[\[183\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-THRPolitical-183)

[Sinéad O'Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O%27Connor "Sinéad O'Connor") tears a picture of [Pope John Paul II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II "Pope John Paul II") apart during a live SNL performance

Due to the show's [live factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_television "Live television"), a number of technical problems, performer mishaps, intentional acts of sabotage by performers, protests, and cuts to [dead air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_air "Dead air") have occurred throughout the show's run. One incident that garnered widespread media coverage was the October 3, 1992, appearance by singer [Sinéad O'Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O%27Connor "Sinéad O'Connor"), in which she ripped up a photo of [Pope John Paul II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II "Pope John Paul II") during her performance.[\[184\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-SalonSinead-184)[\[185\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-AVClubSinead-185) On April 13, 1996, the alternative metal band [Rage Against the Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine "Rage Against the Machine") made a statement about the host, billionaire [Steve Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Forbes "Steve Forbes"), by hanging two [upside-down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_desecration#Flying_an_American_flag_upside_down "Flag desecration") American flags from their amplifiers. On October 23, 2004, [Ashlee Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashlee_Simpson "Ashlee Simpson") appeared as a musical guest, and there was a [lip synching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_synching "Lip synching") mishap. Her first performance, "[Pieces of Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieces_of_Me_(song) "Pieces of Me (song)")," was performed without incident, but when she began her second song, "[Autobiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography_(Ashlee_Simpson_album) "Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)")," the vocals for "Pieces of Me" were heard again through the speakers, even before she had raised the microphone to her mouth. Simpson began to do an impromptu jig and then left the stage.[\[186\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-NBCTodaySimpson-186)

### Minority representation

Over the years, _SNL_ has been criticized for its perceived lack of racial and sexuality minority representation. A 2016 study of _SNL_ episodes from 1975–2016 (826 total) revealed over 90% of episodes had white hosts, while 6.8% were black, 1.2% were Hispanic, and 1.1% were of another racial minority.[\[187\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:5-187) When longtime cast member Kenan Thompson suggested in 2013 that female African-American representation was low because producers were not finding such comediennes who were "ready," media outlets countered it was _SNL_ that was not ready, and that the racial disparity “is symptomatic of problems deeply rooted in comedy and the entertainment industry at large.”[\[188\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-188)[\[189\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-189)[\[190\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:1-190)

_SNL_ has had “little representation from Asian actors, as cast members or hosts," in its run.[\[191\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:0-191)[\[192\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:4-192) Until [Bowen Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Yang "Bowen Yang")’s promotion from writer to on-air performer, there had only been three people of Asian descent on the cast: [Fred Armisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Armisen "Fred Armisen") (2002–2013) had a Korean grandfather; [Rob Schneider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Schneider "Rob Schneider") (1988–1994) had a Filipino grandmother; and [Nasim Pedrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasim_Pedrad "Nasim Pedrad") (2009–2014) was born in [Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran "Tehran"), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran").[\[192\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:4-192) In the first forty-four seasons, the show has had six hosts who were of Asian descent: [Jackie Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Chan "Jackie Chan") and [Lucy Liu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Liu "Lucy Liu") in 2000; [Aziz Ansari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aziz_Ansari "Aziz Ansari") and [Kumail Nanjiani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumail_Nanjiani "Kumail Nanjiani") in 2017; [Awkwafina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awkwafina "Awkwafina") in 2018; and [Sandra Oh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Oh "Sandra Oh") in 2019.[\[187\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:5-187)[\[191\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:0-191)[\[192\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:4-192)[\[193\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-TChan-193)

[LGBTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ "LGBTQ") representation on _SNL_ has also been minimal. As of September 2019, there have been 153 [cast members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_cast_members "Saturday Night Live cast members"); five, or roughly 3.3%, have been openly LGBTQ. Of the 588 [guest hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_guests "List of Saturday Night Live guests") over the first 44 seasons, 14, or roughly 2.4%, were openly LGBTQ at the time of their appearance. Another 14 hosts came out at some point after they had been on the show.

[Terry Sweeney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sweeney "Terry Sweeney") was _SNL’_s first [openly gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out "Coming out") male cast member, appearing in the 1985–1986 season, although he was not hired by [Lorne Michaels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne_Michaels "Lorne Michaels"). Sweeney was also the first openly gay series regular on network television.[\[194\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-shales2-194)[\[195\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-195) [John Milhiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milhiser "John Milhiser") was second, in the 2013–2014 cast[\[196\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-tweet2-196). [Danitra Vance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danitra_Vance "Danitra Vance") was also in the 1985–1986 cast but was in the closet throughout her life. All three cast members left after one season. [Kate McKinnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_McKinnon "Kate McKinnon") was already out before she was cast in 2012.[\[197\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-advocate2-197) She continues to be a cast member as of January 2020.

[Bowen Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Yang "Bowen Yang") is the fifth LGBTQ cast member in _SNL_ history. Numerous news outlets noted the disconnect of Michaels hiring Yang, an out gay Chinese-American cast member, at the same time as [Shane Gillis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Gillis "Shane Gillis"), who was found to have aired homophobic and [anti-Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Asian_racism_in_the_United_States "Anti-Asian racism in the United States") jokes and slurs on his podcast.[\[198\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-198)[\[199\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-using-199) Gillis issued what [_Vox_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(website) "Vox (website)") and _[HuffPost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost "HuffPost")_ characterized as a [non-apology apology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-apology_apology "Non-apology apology").[\[200\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-200)[\[201\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-201) Within days a spokesperson for Michaels announced that Gillis would not be hired in light of the controversy.[\[199\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-using-199)

Jake Weisman, co-star of [Comedy Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central "Comedy Central")’s _Corporate_, says the absence of gay men in the cast is rooted in [homophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia "Homophobia") and [bigotry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry "Bigotry").[\[202\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:42-202) In March 2018, _[NewNowNext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewNowNext "NewNowNext")_ noted, “Even if the audience and writers have changed with the times—and even that’s debatable—Lorne Michaels hasn’t.”[\[202\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-:42-202)

## In other media

### Home media

[Universal Studios Home Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios_Home_Entertainment "Universal Studios Home Entertainment") and [Lions Gate Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Gate_Entertainment "Lions Gate Entertainment") hold video rights to the series. Universal has issued complete season DVD sets of the first few seasons, while Lionsgate's share of the rights is a result of prior contracts with NBC struck before the [NBC Universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Universal "NBC Universal") merger. A majority of Lionsgate's SNL DVDs are "Best Of..." compilations.

### Books

_Saturday Night Live_, the first authorized book about the series, was published by [Avon Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_(publishers) "Avon (publishers)") in 1977 and edited by [Anne Beatts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Beatts "Anne Beatts") and John Head, with photography by Edie Baskin;[\[203\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeattsHead1977-203) all three worked for _SNL_ at the time the book was published. The oversized illustrated paperback included the scripts for several sketches by the 1975–80 cast.[\[204\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-204) In 1986, Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad authored _Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live_, a behind-the-scenes look at the first ten seasons.[\[205\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHillWeingrad1986-205) _Saturday Night Live: The First Twenty Years_, by Michael Cader, was released in 1994 and presented information about the cast, characters, and other memorable moments seen on the show from 1975 to 1994.[\[206\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTECader1994-206)[\[207\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-207)

_Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests_ was released in 2002.[\[208\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShalesMiller2002-208) The book, written by [Tom Shales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Shales "Tom Shales") and James Andrew Miller, consists of interviews from people who have worked on the show. The interviews reveal personal experiences from what happened backstage and the difficulty of getting the show on air each week.[\[209\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-209) In 2004, former cast member [Jay Mohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Mohr "Jay Mohr") released his memoir _[Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasping_for_Airtime:_Two_Years_in_the_Trenches_of_Saturday_Night_Live "Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live")_[\[210\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMohr2004-210) about his struggles during his two seasons on the show between 1993 and 1995, dealing with getting sketches on-air and the intense work schedule. Former cast member [Bobby Moynihan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Moynihan "Bobby Moynihan") described the book as "a handbook on what NOT to do at _SNL_."[\[211\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-BookMohr1-211)

_SNL_ has made several efforts to develop some of the more popular sketches into feature-length films, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The first foray into film came with the successful Aykroyd and Belushi vehicle, _[The Blues Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(film) "The Blues Brothers (film)")_ (1980), which earned over $115 million on a $27 million budget.[\[212\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-BOMBlues-212)

In 1990, Michaels oversaw the writing of a sketch anthology feature film titled _The Saturday Night Live Movie_ with many of the show's then-current writing staff, including [Al Franken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken "Al Franken"), [Tom Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Davis_(comedian) "Tom Davis (comedian)"), [Greg Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels "Greg Daniels"), [Jim Downey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Downey_(comedian) "Jim Downey (comedian)"), [Conan O'Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien "Conan O'Brien"), [Robert Smigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smigel "Robert Smigel"), and [George Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Meyer "George Meyer"), contributing. The screenplay only got as far as a Revised First Draft dated July 26, 1990, before being abandoned.[\[213\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-213)

The success of _Wayne's World_ (1992) encouraged Michaels to produce more film spin-offs, based on several popular sketch characters. Michaels revived 1970s characters for _[Coneheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coneheads_(film) "Coneheads (film)")_ (1993), followed by _[It's Pat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Pat "It's Pat")_ (1994); _[Stuart Saves His Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Saves_His_Family "Stuart Saves His Family")_ (1995); _[A Night at the Roxbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Night_at_the_Roxbury "A Night at the Roxbury")_ (1998), _[Superstar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstar_(1999_film) "Superstar (1999 film)")_ (1999), and _[The Ladies Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ladies_Man_(2000_film) "The Ladies Man (2000 film)")_ (2000). Some did moderately well, though others did not—notably, _It's Pat_, which did so badly at the box office that the studio that made the film, [Touchstone Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchstone_Pictures "Touchstone Pictures") (owned by [The Walt Disney Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company "The Walt Disney Company"), which also owns NBC's rival [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company")), pulled it only one week after releasing it,[\[214\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-214) and _Stuart Saves His Family_, which lost $14 million. Many of these films were produced by [Paramount Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures"). The films based on _The Blues Brothers_ were produced by [Universal Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios "Universal Studios"), which merged with NBC in 2004 to form [NBC Universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal "NBCUniversal") (Universal also has a [joint venture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_International_Pictures "United International Pictures") with Paramount for international distribution of the two studios' films).

The character Bob Roberts from the [Tim Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Robbins "Tim Robbins") [film of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Roberts "Bob Roberts") (1992) first appeared on _SNL_ in a short film about the conservative folk singer.

In addition, the 1999 comedy film _[Office Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space "Office Space")_ originated from a series of animated short films by [Mike Judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Judge "Mike Judge") that aired on _SNL_ in 1993.[\[216\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-216)

The fictitious American folk music trio [The Folksmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Folksmen "The Folksmen") first appeared on _SNL_, performing the song "Old Joe's Place" before later appearing in the film _[A Mighty Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mighty_Wind "A Mighty Wind")_ (2002). The three members of the Folksmen were the same three comedians: [Harry Shearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Shearer "Harry Shearer"), [Michael McKean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McKean "Michael McKean"), and [Christopher Guest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Guest "Christopher Guest"), who also appeared on the same episode as the rock group [Spinal Tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_Tap_(band) "Spinal Tap (band)"). At the time of the appearance (the 1984–85 season), Shearer and Guest were cast members.

_[Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bill%27s_Real_Life_Adventures "Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures")_ is based on the [Mr. Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bill "Mr. Bill") sketches from early seasons of _SNL_.[\[217\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-217)[\[218\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-218)

### Music

In 2005, the comedy troupe [The Lonely Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lonely_Island "The Lonely Island"), consisting of _SNL_ members [Andy Samberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Samberg "Andy Samberg"), [Akiva Schaffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiva_Schaffer "Akiva Schaffer"), and [Jorma Taccone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorma_Taccone "Jorma Taccone"), gained national exposure after joining the show and debuting their comedic music video "[Lazy Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_Sunday_(The_Lonely_Island_song) "Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)")," written with fellow cast member [Chris Parnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Parnell "Chris Parnell"). The song became a surprise hit,[\[219\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-LonelyIsland1-219) and convinced Michaels to encourage the troupe to develop more comedy songs. Further successes with songs including "[Like a Boss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Boss "Like a Boss")," "[Jizz in My Pants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizz_in_My_Pants "Jizz in My Pants")," "[I'm on a Boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_on_a_Boat "I'm on a Boat")," "[We Like Sportz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incredibad "Incredibad")," "[Boombox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incredibad "Incredibad")," and "[Dick in a Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_in_a_Box "Dick in a Box")"—which won the [Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Original_Music_and_Lyrics "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics") in 2007[\[220\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-LonelyIsland2-220)—saw The Lonely Island go on to release two albums, _[Incredibad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incredibad "Incredibad")_ (2009)[\[221\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-LonelyIsland3-221) and _[Turtleneck & Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtleneck_%26_Chain "Turtleneck & Chain")_ (2011), containing _SNL_\-developed songs and original works. The albums were released by [Universal Republic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Republic_Records "Universal Republic Records") who were provided with a license to the _SNL_ songs by NBC and Broadway Video.

A cast album was released in 1976 on the Arista label including the song "Chevy's Girls" and comedy bits from the show (Weekend Update, "Emily Litella," "Gun Control");[\[222\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#cite_note-222) it was later re-issued on CD and MP3 download.

One _SNL_ skit from 1976, titled "Uvula," inspired the title of American Punk Band, [Green Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day "Green Day")'s, song off of 1995's [_Insomniac_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_(Green_Day_album)#In_popular_culture "Insomniac (Green Day album)").

Tesla was founded in July 2003, by engineers [Martin Eberhard](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Martin_Eberhard "Martin Eberhard") and [Marc Tarpenning](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Marc_Tarpenning "Marc Tarpenning"), under the name Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to engineer [Nikola Tesla](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Nikola_Tesla "Nikola Tesla"). In early [Series A funding](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Series_A_round "Series A round"), Tesla Motors was joined by [Elon Musk](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Elon_Musk "Elon Musk"), [J. B. Straubel](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/J._B._Straubel "J. B. Straubel") and Ian Wright, all of whom are retroactively allowed to call themselves co-founders of the company. Musk, who formerly served as [chairman](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Chairman "Chairman") and is the current [chief executive officer](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Chief_executive_officer "Chief executive officer"), said that he envisioned Tesla Motors as a [technology company](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Technology_company "Technology company") and independent [automaker](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Automaker "Automaker"), aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer. Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla in February 2017.

After 10 years in the market, Tesla ranked as the world's best selling [plug-in](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle "Plug-in electric vehicle") passenger car manufacturer in 2018, both as a [brand](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Brand "Brand") and by [automotive group](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Automotive_industry "Automotive industry"), with 245,240 units delivered and a market share of 12% of the plug-in segment sales.[\[24\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Top20Global2018-25)[\[25\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Top10OEM2018-26)[\[26\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Global2018brandshares-27) Tesla vehicle sales in the U.S. increased by 280% from 48,000 in 2017 to 182,400 in 2018,[\[27\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-TeslaUS2018-28) and globally were up by 138% from 2017.[\[28\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-TeslaGlobal2018-29)Tesla has never had a profitable year.[\[29\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-30)However, it has had several profitable quarters starting from the first quarter of 2013 when it posted an $11 million profit.

_Tesla Motors_ was incorporated in July 2003 by [Martin Eberhard](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Martin_Eberhard "Martin Eberhard") and [Marc Tarpenning](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Marc_Tarpenning "Marc Tarpenning") who financed the company until the [Series A round](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Series_A_round "Series A round") of funding.[\[30\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-31) The founders were influenced to start the company after [GM](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/General_Motors "General Motors") recalled all its [EV1](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/General_Motors_EV1 "General Motors EV1") electric cars in 2003 and then destroyed them.[\[31\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-GM-32) Elon Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman. Tesla's primary goal was to commercialize electric vehicles, starting with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then moving into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[\[32\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-MasterPlan-33)

Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level.[\[33\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-34) In addition to his daily operational roles, Musk was the controlling investor in Tesla from the first financing round, funding $6.5M of the Series A capital investment round of US$7.5 million with personal funds.\[_[citation needed](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Musk later led Tesla Motors' [Series B](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Venture_round "Venture round"), $9M of US$13 million, and co-led the third, $12M of US$40 million round in May 2006. Tesla's third round included investment from prominent entrepreneurs including [Google](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Google "Google") co-founders [Sergey Brin](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Sergey_Brin "Sergey Brin") & [Larry Page](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Larry_Page "Larry Page"), former [eBay](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/EBay "EBay") President [Jeff Skoll](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Jeff_Skoll "Jeff Skoll"), [Hyatt](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Hyatt "Hyatt") heir [Nick Pritzker](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Nicholas_J._Pritzker "Nicholas J. Pritzker") and added the VC firms [Draper Fisher Jurvetson](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Draper_Fisher_Jurvetson "Draper Fisher Jurvetson"), Capricorn Management and The Bay Area Equity Fund managed by [JPMorgan Chase](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase "JPMorgan Chase").[\[34\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Motor_Press_Guild_Speech-35) The fourth round in May 2007 added another US$45 million and brought the total investments to over US$105 million through private financing.[\[35\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-36)

Tesla has been reporting net losses most quarters for many years. In 3Q2019, Tesla surprised analysts, who had been anticipating a quarterly loss of approximately 40 cents per share, with adjusted [earnings](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Earnings "Earnings") of US$1.61 per share, on total quarterly revenue of US$6.3 billion.[\[36\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-cnbc20191023-37)

## Strategy

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Tesla_cars%2C_price_and_production3.png/220px-Tesla_cars%2C_price_and_production3.png)

Tesla strategy of starting with low-volume high-priced cars and evolving to higher-volume lower-priced cars.[\[32\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-MasterPlan-33)

Tesla's business [strategy](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Strategic_management "Strategic management") is to emulate [typical technological-product life cycles](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Consumer_electronics#Trends "Consumer electronics") and initially target [affluent buyers](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Economic_surplus "Economic surplus"), and then move into larger markets at lower price points.[\[32\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-MasterPlan-33)[\[37\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-38) The battery and electric drivetrain technology for each model would be developed and partially paid for through the sales of earlier models.[\[32\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-MasterPlan-33)[\[38\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-bbweek20070730-39) The Roadster was low-volume and priced at US$109,000. Model S and Model X targeted the broader luxury market. Model 3 and the Model Y is aimed at a higher-volume segment.[\[39\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-gigaom2-40)[\[40\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-41) This business strategy is common in the technology industry.[\[41\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-42) According to a Musk blog post, "New technology in any field takes a few versions to optimize before reaching the mass market, and in this case it is competing with 150 years and trillions of dollars spent on gasoline cars."[\[42\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Soap_Opera-43)

[Robotic manufacturing](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Automation "Automation") of the Model S at the [Tesla Factory](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Factory "Tesla Factory") in [Fremont, California](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Fremont,_California "Fremont, California")

Tesla's production strategy includes a high degree of [vertical integration](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Vertical_integration "Vertical integration")[\[43\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-44) (80% in 2016[\[44\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-45)), which includes component production and proprietary charging infrastructure. The company operates large factories to capture [economies of scale](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Economies_of_scale "Economies of scale"). Tesla builds electric powertrain components for vehicles from other automakers, including the Smart ED2 [ForTwo electric drive](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Smart_electric_drive "Smart electric drive") (the lowest-priced car from Daimler AG), the Toyota [RAV4 EV](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/RAV4_EV "RAV4 EV"), and [Freightliner's](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Freightliner_Trucks "Freightliner Trucks") Custom Chassis Electric Van. Vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers,[\[45\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-46) and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[\[46\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-gs2016-02-26-47)[\[47\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-48)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/The_Tesla_Patent_Wall_at_HQ%2C_now_set_free.jpg/220px-The_Tesla_Patent_Wall_at_HQ%2C_now_set_free.jpg)

The Tesla Patent Wall at its headquarters was removed after the company announced its patents are part of the [open source movement](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Open-source-software_movement "Open-source-software movement").[\[48\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-49)

Tesla's sales strategy is to sell its vehicles online and in company-owned showrooms rather than through a conventional dealer network. Moving towards an e-commerce strategy, customers are able to customize and order their vehicles online.[\[49\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-teslamotors2-50)[\[50\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-51)

Tesla's technology strategy focuses on pure-electric propulsion technology, and transferring other approaches from the technology industry to transportation, such as online software updates.[\[51\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-52) Tesla allows its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith.[\[52\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-53) Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[\[53\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-54) Tesla retained control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and [trade secrets](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Trade_secret "Trade secret") to prevent direct copying of its technology.[\[54\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-55)

Tesla [Human Resources](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Human_Resources "Human Resources") VP [Arnnon Geshuri](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Arnnon_Geshuri "Arnnon Geshuri") committed to bringing manufacturing jobs "back to California".[\[55\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-56)[\[56\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Mercury-57) In 2015, Geshuri led a hiring surge about which he said: "In the last 14 months we've had 1.5 million applications from around the world. People want to work here."[\[57\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-58) Geshuri emphasizes hiring [veterans](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Veteran "Veteran"), saying "Veterans are a great source of talent for Tesla, and we're going after it."[\[56\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Mercury-57)[\[58\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-59)[\[59\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-60)

## Sales

Tesla delivered 367,500 cars in 2019, 50% more than in 2018 and more than triple the number sold in 2017. At the end of 2019, Tesla's global sales since 2012 totaled over 891,000 units.[\[60\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Tesla4Q2019-61)[\[61\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Tesla4Q2018final-62)[\[28\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-TeslaGlobal2018-29) Year over year Tesla U.S. vehicle sales from 2017 to 2018 increased by 280% from 48,000 to 182,400.[\[27\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-TeslaUS2018-28) As of October 2018, Tesla's sales represented about 20% of the all-electric cars on the world's roads, according to [Navigant Research](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Navigant_Consulting "Navigant Consulting").[\[62\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Tesla500K-63) In July 2017, Tesla said their vehicles had traveled 5 billion miles (8 billion km).[\[63\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-64)

In August of 2015, Tesla launched a revamp of its stores to include interactive displays focused on safety, autopilot, charging network and motors.[\[71\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-72) As of October 2016, Tesla operated about 260 galleries or retail locations in the United States.[\[72\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-73) In June 2016, Tesla opened its first store-within-a-store: a small outpost within the [Nordstrom](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Nordstrom "Nordstrom") department store at [The Grove](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/The_Grove_at_Farmers_Market "The Grove at Farmers Market") shopping mall in [Los Angeles](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles").[\[73\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-74) In 2017, Tesla opened retail locations in [Dubai](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Dubai "Dubai") and [South Korea](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea").[\[74\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-75)

Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as [ship availability](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Car_carrier "Car carrier") and registration. Tesla does not follow the former auto industry standard of monthly reporting; GM and Ford changed from monthly to quarterly sales reporting in 2018 and 2019.[\[114\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-118) Some monthly sales are estimated by media.[\[115\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-119)

Tesla operates stores and galleries[\[116\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-120)[\[117\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-121)—usually located in shopping malls—in many U.S. states. However, customers buy vehicles only from the Tesla website.[\[118\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-122)[\[119\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-123)[\[120\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-124)[\[121\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-125) The stores serve as showrooms that allow people to learn about the company and its vehicles. Some galleries are located in states with restrictive dealer protection laws that prohibit discussing price, financing, and test drives, as well as other restrictions.

Tesla's strategy of direct customer sales and owning stores and service centers is different from the standard dealership model in the global vehicle marketplace. Tesla is the only automaker that sells cars directly to consumers; all others use independently owned dealerships,[\[122\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-126)[\[123\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-127) although many provide online configuration and financing.[\[124\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-128)[\[125\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-129)[\[126\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-130) 48 states have laws that limit or ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers,[\[127\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-131)[\[128\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-132)[\[129\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-133) and although Tesla has no independent dealerships, dealership associations in multiple states have filed lawsuits over Tesla's sales practices.

Countries other than U.S. do not protect dealers. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission "Federal Trade Commission") recommends allowing direct manufacturer sales,[\[130\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-134)[\[131\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-135) which analysts believe would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[\[132\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-136)[\[133\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-137)

In February 2019, Tesla announced that it would shut down the bulk of its stores and begin to sell cars exclusively through the internet.[\[134\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-138) The next month, the company reversed its decision, saying in a government filing that it would only close about half the number of showrooms it had originally intended to.[\[135\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-139)

### Used vehicles

Under a buyback program called the _[Resale Value Guarantee](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Trade-In_Protection "Trade-In Protection")_ available in 37 U.S. states, a Tesla Model S sold new before July 1, 2016 included the right to return it after three years with reimbursement of 43% to 50% of its initial price. This reimbursement matched the trade-in values of competitive German luxury cars of that age. In addition to maintaining the resale value, Tesla hoped to secure a supply of used cars to refurbish and re-sell with [warranty](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Warranty "Warranty"). According to [Automotive News](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Automotive_News "Automotive News"), the [profit margin](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Profit_margin "Profit margin") on used car sales in the U.S. is about triple that on new cars, and Tesla's direct sales would allow them to capture resale profits.[\[136\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-140) Tesla ended the program in 2016, although they retained the Residual Value Guarantee on leased vehicles.[\[137\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-141)[\[138\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-142)\[_[needs update](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_\]

In May 2015, Tesla started selling refurbished Model S cars in the U.S.[\[139\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-143) and within a month sold 1,600 cars.[\[140\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-144) As of July 2017, over 80 used Model S and Model X cars were for sale, with either a four-year, 50,000-mile warranty[\[141\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-145) or a two-year, 100,000-mile warranty for vehicles above 50,000 miles.[\[142\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-146)[\[143\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-147) As of September 2015, similar programs existed in Canada,[\[144\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-148) Austria,[\[145\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-149) Belgium,[\[146\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-150) Denmark,[\[147\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-151) France,[\[148\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-152) Germany,[\[149\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-153) Britain,[\[150\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-154) Netherlands,[\[151\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-155) Norway,[\[152\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-156) Sweden[\[153\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-157) and Switzerland.[\[154\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-158)\[_[needs update](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_\]

## Technology

As a vertically integrated manufacturer, Tesla has had to master multiple technology domains, including batteries, electric motors, sensors, and [artificial intelligence](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence").

Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not use individual large [battery cells](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Battery_cell "Battery cell"), but thousands of small, cylindrical, lithium-ion [commodity cells](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Commodity_cell "Commodity cell") like those used in consumer electronics. It uses a version of these cells that is designed to be cheaper to manufacture and lighter than standard cells by removing some safety features. According to Tesla, these features are redundant because of the advanced thermal management system and an [intumescent](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Intumescent "Intumescent") chemical in the battery to prevent fires.[\[155\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-gcr2013-06-159) [Panasonic](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Panasonic "Panasonic") is the sole supplier of the cells for Model S, Model X, and Model 3 and cooperates with Tesla in the Gigafactory 1's '[21–70](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes#List_of_Li-ion_sizes "List of battery sizes")' [cells](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Electrochemical_cell "Electrochemical cell").[\[156\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-160)

In February 2016, Tesla battery cell costs were estimated at US$200 per kWh.[\[46\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-gs2016-02-26-47) Tesla indicated later in 2016 that their battery cells cost less than $190/kWh.[\[157\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-161) Still later that year [Argonne Labs](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Argonne_National_Laboratory "Argonne National Laboratory") estimated $163/kWh at a production rate of 500,000 packs per year.[\[158\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-162)[\[159\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-163) In the 2018 Tesla Shareholder meeting, Elon Musk stated battery cell cost could be $100/kWh in 2018. 2020 would bring $100/kWh Tesla battery packs (as opposed to battery cell).[\[160\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-164)

The batteries are placed under the vehicle floor. This saves interior and trunk (boot) space but increases the risk of [battery damage by debris or impact](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle_fire_incidents#Tesla_Model_S "Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents"). The Model S has 0.25 in (6.4 mm) [aluminum-alloy](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Aluminium_alloy "Aluminium alloy") armor plate.[\[161\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-165) CTO Straubel expected batteries to last 10–15 years,[\[162\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-166) and discounts [using electric cars to charge the grid (V2G)](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Vehicle-to-grid "Vehicle-to-grid") because the related battery wear outweighs economic benefit. He also prefers recycling over [re-use for grid](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Battery_storage "Battery storage") once they reach the end of their useful life for vehicles.[\[163\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-167)[\[164\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-168) Since 2008, Tesla has worked with ToxCo/Kinsbursky to [recycle](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery_recycling "Lithium-ion battery recycling") worn out [RoHS](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive "Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive") batteries, which will be an integral part of all Gigafactories.[\[165\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-169)[\[166\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-170)[\[167\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-171)

### Motors

Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors. Their oldest currently-produced design is a [three-phase](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power "Three-phase electric power") four-pole [AC](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") [induction motor](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Induction_motor "Induction motor") with a copper [rotor](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Rotor_(electric) "Rotor (electric)")[\[168\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-172) (which inspired the Tesla logo), which is used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X. Newer, higher-efficiency [permanent magnet motors](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Permanent_magnet_motor "Permanent magnet motor")\[_[clarification needed](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_\] are used in the Model 3, Model Y, Semi, and the front motor of newer (early 2019 and onward) versions of the Model S and X.[\[169\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-173)

Tesla Semi truck

The [Tesla Semi](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Semi "Tesla Semi") is an all-electric [Class 8](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Class_8_truck "Class 8 truck") [semi-trailer truck](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck "Semi-trailer truck") first mentioned in the 2016 Tesla Master plan.[\[244\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-248)

The vehicle's official announcement was at a November 16, 2017 press conference where two prototypes were shown. Musk confirmed that two variants would be available: one with 300 miles (480 km) and one with 500 miles (800 km) of range, and that the 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time would be 5 seconds versus 15 seconds for a similar truck with a diesel engine.[\[245\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-249) The Semi will be powered by four electric motors of the type used in the [Tesla Model 3](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Model_3 "Tesla Model 3") and will include an extensive set of hardware sensors to enable it to stay in its own lane, a safe distance away from other vehicles, and later, when software and regulatory conditions allow, provide [self-driving](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Self-driving_car "Self-driving car") operation on highways.[\[246\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-250) Musk also announced that the company would be involved in installing a solar-powered global network of the [Tesla Megacharger](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Megacharger "Tesla Megacharger") devices to make the Semi more attractive to potential long-haul customers. A 30-minute charge would provide 400 miles (640 km) of range.[\[247\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-251)[\[248\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-252)

In August 2013, Tesla trademarked the name "Model Y".[\[249\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-253) In October 2015, Musk described a future "Model Y".[\[250\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-254) In August 2017, Tesla announced that the Model Y would use the Model 3 platform.[\[251\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-255)

In February 2018, Tesla announced that they would unveil Model Y production plans within the next 3–6 months[\[252\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-256) and posted open positions for Model Y production and design. In May 2018, Musk said that the Model Y will be built on a platform that shares many components with the Model 3, and that the Model Y will be in production at the earliest in early 2020.[\[253\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-257) In July 2018, Musk rescheduled the Model Y unveiling to be March 2019.[\[254\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-258) In March 2019, Musk tweeted, "Model Y unveil event on March 14 at LA Design Studio"[\[255\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-259) also adding that "the Model Y would be 10% bigger than the Model 3 so would cost 10% more".[\[256\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-260)

The Model Y unveiling occurred on March 14, 2019.[\[257\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Lambert-261) The car will have up to three rows of seats (up to 7 people), 66 cu ft (2 m3) of cargo space with the second and third rows folded, and will have a range of up to 300 miles (480 km).[\[257\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Lambert-261)

The Tesla Model Y will be manufactured at [Tesla Factory](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Factory "Tesla Factory") in Fremont, CA.[\[258\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Bloomberg-262) In the future, the Model Y is also planned to be built at the yet-to-be-built [Gigafactory Berlin](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Gigafactory_Berlin "Gigafactory Berlin"), newly announced in November 2019.[\[259\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-electrek20191112-263)

In August 2019, some analysts and journalists were speculating about the Tesla pickup truck being the Tesla Model B. The International Business Times reported that recent Musk "bee tweets, ... could very well be teasers of the Tesla Model B."[\[260\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-264) The [Cybertruck](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck "Tesla Cybertruck") was unveiled on 21 November 2019, announcing production set for late 2021.[\[261\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-265)[\[262\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-266) Five days after the reveal, Cybertruck had more than 250,000 preorders.[\[263\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-267)

### Discontinued

#### Roadster (2008)

The Tesla Roadster is a battery electric vehicle (BEV) sports car, based on the Lotus Elise chassis, that was produced by the electric car firm Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.) in California from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 320 km (200 miles) per charge. It is also the first production car to be launched into [orbit](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit"), carried by a [Falcon Heavy](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Falcon_Heavy "Falcon Heavy") rocket in a test flight on February 6, 2018.[\[264\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-268)

### Other concepts

In 2016, Musk indicated he hoped to one day produce a car cheaper than the Model 3:[\[265\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-269)[\[266\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-270)

> There will be future cars that will be even more affordable down the road . . . With fourth generation and smaller cars and what not, we'll ultimately be in a position where everyone can afford the car.
> 
> — Elon Musk at the Future Transport Solutions conference in Oslo, April 21, 2016

Musk wanted the first three models to spell "SEX", but [Ford](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Ford "Ford") owns the trademark to "Model E",[\[267\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-271) so he settled for "S3XY" by making the Model Y.[\[268\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-272)

On July 20, 2016, Musk detailed his new master plan for Tesla. It includes more affordable cars produced in higher volume, solar-power roofs, mid-size vehicles, SUVs and pickup trucks, as well as the refinement of autonomous vehicles and the creation of a [sharing economy](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Sharing_economy "Sharing economy"), in which cars can be active while the owner is not using them.[\[269\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-273) Tesla intends to build a minibus on the Model X platform.[\[270\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-274) In May 2017, Musk indicated that he might favor a 10-12 passenger version of the Model X over a dedicated minibus design.[\[271\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-275)

At the company's annual shareholder meeting in June 2018, Musk revealed Tesla's intention to enter a new market segment, offering a compact hatchback in "less than five years".[\[272\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-276)[\[273\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-277) He provided no details, and dodged a question about also producing a subcompact. Musk also put to rest hopes for a Tesla motorcycle, saying "we’re not going to do motorcycles".[\[274\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-278) However, in November 2019 during the unveiling of the [Tesla Cybertruck](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck "Tesla Cybertruck"), Musk also unveiled a [Tesla ATV](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Cyberquad "Tesla Cyberquad") that was capable of charging from the cargo bed of the Cybertruck.[\[275\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-279)

In April 2019 Elon Musk announced Tesla is going to launch an unmanned taxi by the end of 2020. The company plans to have more than 1 million unmanned vehicles by this time.[\[276\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-280)

In April 2015, the company unveiled its [Powerwall](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Powerwall "Tesla Powerwall") home and [Powerpack](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Powerpack "Tesla Powerpack") industrial battery packs,[\[277\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-pw-281)[\[278\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-282)[\[279\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-283) and quickly received orders valued at US$800 million.[\[280\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-284) The two models included a 7-kilowatt-hour (25 MJ) wall-mounted unit and 10 kWh (36 MJ) unit. The company announced larger-scale configurations for industrial users in units of 100 kWh (360 MJ). The company planned to [open source](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Open-source_model "Open-source model") its patents for the entire range.

Initial cells were made by [Panasonic](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Panasonic "Panasonic"). When production shifted to Gigafactory 1,[\[281\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-285) Tesla expected costs to drop by 30%.[\[277\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-pw-281)

In September 2016, Tesla announced it had been chosen "through a competitive process" to supply [Southern California Edison](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Southern_California_Edison "Southern California Edison") (SCE) with 27,000 hp (20 MW) [power](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Electric_power "Electric power") (and 80 MWh or 290 GJ [energy](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Electrical_energy "Electrical energy")) of battery storage. In May 2016, regulators had ordered SCE to invest in utility-scale battery systems to compensate local power supply after [natural gas](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Natural_gas "Natural gas") provider [Southern California Gas](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Southern_California_Gas_Company "Southern California Gas Company") leaked 1.6 million pounds (730 t) of [methane](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Methane "Methane") into the atmosphere when a well ruptured at its [Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Aliso_Canyon_Natural_Gas_Storage_Facility "Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility"), closing it permanently.[\[282\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-286)

In November 2016, [American Samoa](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/American_Samoa "American Samoa")'s island of [Ta'u](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Ta%E2%80%98%C5%AB "Ta‘ū") with a population of approximately 600 was converted to a solar and battery [microgrid](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Microgrid "Microgrid") from diesel-based energy generation.[\[283\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-287) In 2018, two microgrid projects were built in [Samoa](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Samoa "Samoa") on the main island of [Upolu](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Upolu "Upolu"): one at the Fiaga power station and one at the [Faleolo International Airport](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Faleolo_International_Airport "Faleolo International Airport").[\[284\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-288)

After [Hurricane Maria](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Hurricane_Maria "Hurricane Maria") in September 2017, Elon Musk offered to work with [Puerto Rico's government](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Government_of_Puerto_Rico "Government of Puerto Rico") in rebuilding the island's electrical grid. In October 2017, Tesla brought 700 solar panels to the "Hospital del Niño," where the batteries helped bring care back to 3,000 patients who needed constant care.[\[285\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-289)

In June 2017, Hawaii's [Kauai](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Kauai#energy "Kauai") island received a large solar and battery installation, converting the island's energy generation to 97% solar.[\[286\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-290)

In July 2017, Tesla won a contract to install the [world's biggest grid-scale](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Battery_storage_power_station#Largest_grid_batteries "Battery storage power station") lithium battery in South Australia by promising installation within 100 days.[\[287\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-291) The [Hornsdale Power Reserve](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve "Hornsdale Power Reserve") with total power capacity of 130,000 horsepower (100 MW) was connected to the grid on December 1, 2017.

As of January 2019, Tesla was in talks with the government of [Greece](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Greece "Greece") to provide solar and battery system for their islands with a proposed pilot on [Limnos](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Lemnos "Lemnos").[\[288\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-292)

In February 2019, Tesla announced that it planned to acquire [ultracapacitor](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Ultracapacitor "Ultracapacitor") energy storage manufacturer [Maxwell Technologies](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Maxwell_Technologies "Maxwell Technologies").[\[289\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-sec.gov-293)[\[290\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-294)[\[291\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-295)[\[292\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-296)\[_[needs update](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_\]

In July 2019, Tesla unveiled [Megapack](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Megapack "Tesla Megapack"), a [containerized](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Shipping_container "Shipping container") battery product for utility-scale projects. Each Megapack comes fully assembled from the factory with up to 3 MWh (11 GJ) of storage and 2,000 hp (1.5 MW) of inverter capacity.[\[293\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-297)

Tesla destination charger in North America

In 2012, Tesla began building a network of 480-volt [fast-charging _Supercharger_ stations](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Charging_speed "Charging speed"). As of December 2018, there are 1,375 Supercharger stations operated globally with 11,414 superchargers.[\[294\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Supercharger_{{!}}_Tesla_Motors-298) The Supercharger is a proprietary [direct current](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current") (DC) technology that provides up to 340 hp (250 kW) of power.[\[294\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-Supercharger_{{!}}_Tesla_Motors-298) Tesla cars can recommend the fastest route for long-distance travel, incorporating possible charging delays.[\[295\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-299)

All Tesla cars (except the original Roadster) come standard with Supercharging hardware. Model S and X cars ordered after January 15, 2017 get 400 kWh (1,400 MJ) of free Supercharging credits, which provides a range of roughly 1,000 miles per year (1,600 [km/a](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Speed "Speed")). Cars purchased before that date received free supercharging.[\[296\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-300) From August 3, 2019, all Tesla Model X's and S's come standard with unlimited supercharging.

In December 2016, after a complaint sent to Musk via [Twitter](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") about abuse, Tesla announced that it will start charging an "idle" fee for vehicles that continue to occupy charging stations after they are fully charged.[\[297\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-301)[\[298\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-302)

### Destination charging location network

In 2014, Tesla discreetly launched the "Destination Charging Location" Network by providing chargers to hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, resorts and other full service stations to provide on-site vehicle charging at twice the power of a typical charging location.[\[299\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-303)[\[300\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-304)[\[301\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-305) On April 25, 2016, Tesla launched European destination charging, with 150 locations and more to be added later.[\[302\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-306) Chargers are installed free of charge by Tesla-certified contractors. All installed chargers appear in the in-car navigation system.[\[303\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-307)

## Facilities

In addition to its corporate headquarters, the company operates multiple large factories for making vehicles and their components. The company operates[\[304\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-308) showrooms and galleries around the world.[\[305\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-309)

Tesla was founded in [San Carlos, California](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/San_Carlos,_California "San Carlos, California").[\[306\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-310) Tesla's first retail stores were in Los Angeles,[\[307\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-311) in [Menlo Park, California](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California "Menlo Park, California")[\[308\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-312) and in Manhattan's [Chelsea](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Chelsea,_Manhattan "Chelsea, Manhattan") art district, followed by others in major US cities.[\[49\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-teslamotors2-50) In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[\[309\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-313)

Tesla's first assembly plant occupies the former [NUMMI](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/NUMMI "NUMMI") plant in Fremont, California.[\[310\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-314)[\[311\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-315) It is known as the Tesla Factory.[\[312\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-316) As of 2016, the plant was not highly automated—it was expected to produce some 80,000 cars with 6,000 workers compared to a "typical" plant that might produce 250,000 cars with 3,000 workers.[\[313\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-317) The 370-acre (1,500,000 m2) site includes a 5,500,000-square-foot (510,000 m2) building complex.[\[314\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-318)

On April 1, 2019, Tesla reached a settlement with the [United States Environmental Protection Agency](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency "United States Environmental Protection Agency") (EPA) over its mishandling of hazardous waste in 2017. Tesla allowed hazardous waste to accumulate on site without a permit beyond the allowed 90 days; the EPA found Tesla failed to "promptly clean up flammable paint and or solvent mixtures", left two 55-US-gallon (210 L) containers of hazardous waste open with "no gasket or locking mechanism", and violated air emission standards for three leaky transmission lines that the waste moved through.[\[315\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-319)

In 2015, Tesla acquired Riviera Tool & Die (with 100 employees in [Michigan](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Michigan "Michigan")), one of its suppliers of [stamping](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Stamping_(metalworking) "Stamping (metalworking)") items.[\[316\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-320)[\[317\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-321) In 2017, Tesla acquired Perbix Machine Company, a manufacturer of automated manufacturing equipment, that had been an equipment supplier for over three years.[\[318\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-322)

Tesla occupies a second factory in Fremont. The building is more than 500,000 sq ft (46,500 m2). The location is next to a SolarCity facility, a few miles from the original Fremont plant.[\[319\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-323)

Gigafactory 1 is located outside Reno, Nevada. As of January 2017, it occupied 1.9 million square feet (180,000 m2) with 4.9 million square feet (460,000 m2) of usable area across several floors.[\[320\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-324) It produces [Powerwalls and Powerpacks](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Powerwall "Tesla Powerwall")[\[321\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-325)[\[322\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-326) as well as battery cells[\[323\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-327) in partnership with Panasonic. It also produces Model 3 battery packs and drivetrains.[\[324\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-328) The factory received substantial subsidies from the local and state governments.[\[325\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-329) In August 2018, Karl Hansen, a former member of the company's security team, filed a whistleblower tip with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"). In the tip, he alleged that Tesla suppressed an internal investigation into various criminal activities at the Nevada Gigafactory. Hansen said that the company refused to tell the [DEA](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration "Drug Enforcement Administration") about several employees who were allegedly moving [cocaine](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Cocaine "Cocaine") and [crystal methamphetamine](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Methamphetamine "Methamphetamine") on behalf of a Mexican [drug cartel](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Drug_cartel "Drug cartel"). He also said that the company tried to get him to not report a $37 million theft of raw materials. Additionally, he said the company fired an employee who reported the theft, and gave the reason that the employee was "not a Tesla team player."[\[326\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-330)

The Gigafactory 2 is located in [Buffalo, New York](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York "Buffalo, New York") on the site of a former [Republic Steel](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Republic_Steel "Republic Steel") plant. It is operated by Tesla's SolarCity unit. The factory is a $750 million, 1.2-million-square-foot (0.11 km2) facility that directly employs 500 workers. Tesla partnered with Panasonic to assemble [photovoltaic](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Photovoltaics "Photovoltaics") panel modules. Tesla received incentives to locate the factory in Buffalo through the [Buffalo Billion](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Buffalo_Billion "Buffalo Billion") program.[\[327\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-331)[\[328\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-332)[\[329\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-333)[\[330\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-334) As of August 2017, the factory added production of solar tiles for the Tesla Solar Roof.[\[331\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-UpAndRunning-335) In January 2018, Tesla announced, after testing on employees' roofs, that it would begin installing the Tesla Solar Roof on customers' homes "within the next few months".[\[332\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-336) Version 3 of the [Tesla Solar Roof](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Solar_Roof "Tesla Solar Roof") was announced in October 2019, with this version achieving economic viability to be cost competitive for installations where a new roof is needed and residential solar power is desired. Production ramp up is expected to occur into 2020 as Tesla works through anticipated ramp-up issues with the new mass manufactured and mass installed product.[\[333\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-337)

## Product issues

### Recalls

As of March 2018, Tesla had issued two [product recalls](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Product_recall "Product recall") for the [Roadster](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)#Recalls "Tesla Roadster (2008)"), six for the [Model S](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Model_S "Tesla Model S") and two for the [Model X](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_Model_X#Recalls "Tesla Model X").[\[398\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-402)

On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and "prevent the vehicles from moving".[\[399\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-403)[\[400\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-404)

On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to [corrosion](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion")\-susceptible [power steering](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Power_steering "Power steering") bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use "increased force" to control the vehicle.[\[401\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-405)

On October 1, 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in [Kent, Washington](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Kent,_Washington "Kent, Washington"). Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the "direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 modules within the Model S battery pack."[\[402\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-406) On November 6, 2013, a Tesla Model S on Interstate 24 near [Murfreesboro, Tennessee](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Murfreesboro,_Tennessee "Murfreesboro, Tennessee"), caught fire after it struck a [tow hitch](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tow_hitch "Tow hitch") on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle. Tesla said that it would conduct its own investigation,[\[403\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-407) and as a result of these incidents, announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[\[404\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-408)

On January 4, 2014, a Tesla Model S in Norway caught fire while charging at one of Tesla's supercharger stations and was completely destroyed. No one was injured.[\[405\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-409)

On March 28, 2014, [NHTSA](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration") announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after the automaker said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[\[406\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-410) All Model S cars manufactured after March 6 have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[\[407\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-411)

A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer on May 7, 2016, in [Williston, Florida](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Williston,_Florida "Williston, Florida"), while the vehicle was in autopilot mode. The driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in autopilot mode.[\[408\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-412)[\[409\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-413) The NHTSA investigated the accident and concluded: "A safety-related defect trend has not been identified at this time and further examination of this issue does not appear to be warranted."[\[410\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-414)

On May 8, 2018, two 18-year-olds, driver Barrett Riley and passenger Edgar Monserratt Martinez, died in a fire in [Fort Lauderdale, Florida](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida "Fort Lauderdale, Florida") that started after crashing a Tesla Model S into a wall at 116 mph. Speed is believed to have been a factor in the crash.[\[411\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-415)[\[412\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-416)[\[413\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-417) Less than two months before the crash, it was reported that Riley's parents had a limiter installed to limit the speed to 85 mph, but it was removed at another Tesla service visit without the parents' knowledge. The removal of the limiter and alleged defective battery pack formed the basis of a lawsuit against Tesla by the estate of Edgar Monserratt Martinez. The lawsuit was filed on January 9, 2019.[\[414\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-418)

### Maintenance costs, crash rates, and insurance costs

On June 4, 2017, the [American Automobile Association](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/American_Automobile_Association "American Automobile Association") raised insurance rates for Tesla owners following a report from the Highway Loss Data Institute. The report concluded that the Model S crashes 46% more often and is 50% more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles. Similarly, the Model X was concluded to crash 41% more often and to be 89% more expensive to repair than similar vehicles. As a result, AAA raised insurance rates on Tesla cars by 30%. Tesla said that the analysis is "severely flawed and not reflective of reality", however, Tesla failed to provide any contradictory numbers.[\[415\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-419) Shortly thereafter, Russ Rader, the spokesman for the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety "Insurance Institute for Highway Safety"), confirmed the AAA's analysis and that "Teslas get into a lot of crashes and are costly to repair afterward".[\[416\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-420)[\[417\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-421)

### Delays

Tesla has been criticized for repeatedly overpromising and underdelivering. Delivery dates for new vehicles and new vehicle features slipped on the Roadster, Model S, Model X and Model 3. Advanced technologies like the prospect of a large network of [solar-powered](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Solar-power "Solar-power") supercharger stations (first installation was in 2012; only two were solar-powered as of late 2014) also lagged projections.[\[418\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-422)

In early October 2017, Musk had predicted that Model 3 production would be up to 5,000 units per week by December.[\[419\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-423) A month later, he revised that target to "sometime in March" 2018 due in part to difficulties with robots on the assembly line, but primarily due to problems with the battery module.[\[420\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-WP_production-hell-424) An analyst with Cowan and Company, a public relations firm, made this comment: "Elon Musk needs to stop over promising and under delivering".[\[421\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-425)

On September 24, 2018, Musk revealed on [Twitter](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") that Tesla will be building its own car carriers as the company is facing challenges due to logistics. Tesla is running into an acute shortage of car carrier trailers leading to a delay in the delivery.[\[422\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-426) In mid-November, with end-of-year buyer tax credits expiring in a little more than six weeks, Musk announced that the company was aggressively ramping up delivery capabilities with trucking contracts and even outright purchase of some trucking firms to deliver as many cars as possible before the deadline.[\[423\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-427)

### Hacking

In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by [hacking](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Security_hacker "Security hacker") into the car's entertainment system.[\[424\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-428) The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[\[425\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-429) Tesla issued a [security update](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Patch_(computing) "Patch (computing)") for the Model S the day after the [exploit](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security) "Exploit (computer security)") was announced.[\[426\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-430)

In September 2016, researchers at [Tencent](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tencent "Tencent")'s Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus ([CAN bus](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/CAN_bus "CAN bus")) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[\[427\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-431) This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their [bug bounty program](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Bug_bounty_program "Bug bounty program")[\[428\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-teslaHack-432) and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[\[429\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-433) Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[\[430\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-434)

In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an [Amazon Web Services](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services "Amazon Web Services") account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account [had been exploited](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security) "Black hat (computer security)") for [cryptocurrency](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency") mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[\[431\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-435)[\[432\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-436)

In 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to [benevolent hackers](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security) "White hat (computer security)") during a [Pwn2Own](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Pwn2Own "Pwn2Own") Model 3 Hacking Event.[\[433\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-437)

### Servicing

Tesla offers service at its service centers. If a center is not available, mobile technicians can perform most inspections and repairs. In 2016, Tesla recommended to have any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first.[\[434\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-438) In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: "your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes," and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[\[435\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-439)

The first units for each new model revealed design and manufacturing flaws, including the Model S and the Model X.[\[436\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-440)[\[437\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-441) As the Tesla vehicle fleet grew, the number of service centers resulted in waiting periods for some owners.[\[438\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-tccService-442) [Auto experts](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Kelley_Blue_Book "Kelley Blue Book") view the service delays as insignificant, as owners accept the challenges of servicing a new type of car.[\[438\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-tccService-442) Tesla does not provide service manuals except in jurisdictions that [required them to do so](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Motor_Vehicle_Owners%27_Right_to_Repair_Act "Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act").[\[439\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-443)

At the June 2018 shareholder meeting, Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla will soon start to open its first body shops in the top ten U.S. metropolitan areas, stocking some body parts, potentially allowing for same-day service.[\[440\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-444)\[_[needs update](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_\]

## Lobbying activity

In response to constant state auto dealers associations lobbying to prevent [Tesla from selling cars directly](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Tesla_US_dealership_disputes "Tesla US dealership disputes") to the public, Tesla has lobbied in several states for the right to sell cars. In June 2017, Tesla made a "last-minute push near the end of the Albany legislative session to expand its sales force in New York."[\[441\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-tesla-lobbying-445) [New York State Legislature](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/New_York_State_Legislature "New York State Legislature") bill A.8248/S.6600 would allow Tesla to operate 20 sales locations in the state, up from its current 5. Automotive dealers attacked the bill, arguing that it would hurt their business because Tesla does not sell through dealers. According to the _New York Law Journal_, "Tesla . . . has its own in-house lobbyists, according to disclosures filed with the state's lobbying entity."[\[441\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-tesla-lobbying-445) The bill did not get to the floor of either house.[\[442\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-446)[\[443\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-447)

A group of investors asked Tesla in a 2017 public letter to add two new independent directors to its board “who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk”.[\[445\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-449) The investors wrote that “five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.”[\[446\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-USA-Today-2017-04-12-450) The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on [groupthink](https://tui-elo.github.io/wiki/Groupthink "Groupthink").[\[446\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-USA-Today-2017-04-12-450) At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors "should buy Ford stock" because "their governance is amazing.”[\[446\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-USA-Today-2017-04-12-450) Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members.[\[447\]](https://tui-elo.github.io/static-page/#cite_note-451)

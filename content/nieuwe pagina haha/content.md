From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

_**The Office**_ is an American [mockumentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary "Mockumentary") sitcom television series that depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [Scranton, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania "Scranton, Pennsylvania") branch of the fictional [Dunder Mifflin Paper Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin "Dunder Mifflin"). It aired on [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC "NBC") from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, lasting a total of nine seasons.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-1) It is an [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation "Film adaptation") of the original [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") [series of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(British_TV_series) "The Office (British TV series)") and was adapted for American television by [Greg Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels "Greg Daniels"), a veteran writer for _[Saturday Night Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live "Saturday Night Live")_, _[King of the Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill "King of the Hill")_, and _[The Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons "The Simpsons")_. It was co-produced by Daniels' [Deedle-Dee Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deedle-Dee_Productions "Deedle-Dee Productions"), and [Reveille Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reveille_Productions "Reveille Productions") (later [Shine America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemol_Shine_North_America "Endemol Shine North America")), in association with [Universal Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Television "Universal Television"). The original [executive producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer "Executive producer") were Daniels, [Howard Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Klein_(television_producer) "Howard Klein (television producer)"), [Ben Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Silverman "Ben Silverman"), [Ricky Gervais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais "Ricky Gervais"), and [Stephen Merchant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Merchant "Stephen Merchant"), with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.

To [simulate the look of an actual documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary "Mockumentary") it was filmed in a [single-camera setup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-camera_setup "Single-camera setup") without a [studio audience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_audience "Studio audience") or a [laugh track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track "Laugh track"). The series debuted on NBC as a [mid-season replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-season_replacement "Mid-season replacement") and aired [201 episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Office_(American_TV_series)_episodes "List of The Office (American TV series) episodes") over the course of its run. _The Office_ originally featured [Steve Carell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell "Steve Carell"), [Rainn Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson "Rainn Wilson"), [John Krasinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski "John Krasinski"), [Jenna Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer "Jenna Fischer"), and [B. J. Novak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Novak "B. J. Novak") as the main cast, however, the series experienced [numerous changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Office_(American_TV_series)_characters "List of The Office (American TV series) characters") to its [ensemble cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast "Ensemble cast") during its run. Notable stars outside the original main cast include [Ed Helms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Helms "Ed Helms"), [Mindy Kaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindy_Kaling "Mindy Kaling"), [Craig Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Robinson_(actor) "Craig Robinson (actor)"), [James Spader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Spader "James Spader"), and [Ellie Kemper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellie_Kemper "Ellie Kemper").

_The Office_ was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following several seasons received acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [Peabody Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Award "Peabody Award") in 2006, two [Screen Actors Guild Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards "Screen Actors Guild Awards"), a [Golden Globe Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award "Golden Globe Award") for Carell's [performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_%E2%80%93_Television_Series_Musical_or_Comedy "Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy"), and four [Primetime Emmy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Awards "Primetime Emmy Awards"), including one for [Outstanding Comedy Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Comedy_Series "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series") in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor. However, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The [series finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finale_(The_Office) "Finale (The Office)") was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-2)

[Greg Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels "Greg Daniels") served as the senior series [showrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner "Showrunner") for the first four seasons of the series and developed [the British _Office_ series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(British_TV_series) "The Office (British TV series)") for American television. He then left the position when he co-created the comedy series _[Parks and Recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation "Parks and Recreation")_ with fellow _Office_ writer [Michael Schur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schur "Michael Schur") and divided his time between the two series.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-3) [Paul Lieberstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lieberstein "Paul Lieberstein") and [Jennifer Celotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Celotta "Jennifer Celotta") were named the series showrunners for the fifth season.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Sepinwall-4) Celotta left the series after the sixth season and Lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons. He left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential Dwight Schrute spin-off, _The Farm_, which was eventually passed up by NBC.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-liebersteinleaving-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-6) Daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-s9_showrunner-7) Other executive producers include cast members [B.J. Novak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.J._Novak "B.J. Novak") and [Mindy Kaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindy_Kaling "Mindy Kaling").[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-9) Kaling, Novak, Daniels, Lieberstein and Schur made up the original team of writers.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-10) Kaling, Novak, and Lieberstein also serve multiple roles on the series, as they play regular characters on the show, as well as write, direct, and produce episodes.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-prolific-11) Credited with twenty-four episodes, Kaling is the most prolific writer among the staff.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-prolific-11) [Ricky Gervais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais "Ricky Gervais") and [Stephen Merchant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Merchant "Stephen Merchant"), who created the original British series, are credited as executive producer and wrote the [pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(The_Office) "Pilot (The Office)") and the third-season episode, "[The Convict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Convict "The Convict")."[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-12) Merchant later directed the episode "[Customer Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_Survey "Customer Survey")" while Gervais appeared in the episodes "[The Seminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seminar "The Seminar")" and "[Search Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_Committee "Search Committee")."[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-rickyguest-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-ep26-14)

[Randall Einhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Einhorn "Randall Einhorn") is the most frequent director of the series, with 15 credited episodes.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-prolific-11) The series also had several guest directors, including _[Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series) "Lost (TV series)")_ co-creator [J.J. Abrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.J._Abrams "J.J. Abrams"), _[Buffy the Vampire Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer "Buffy the Vampire Slayer")_ creator [Joss Whedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon "Joss Whedon"),[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-15)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-16) both of whom are fans of the series,[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-whedon-18) and filmmakers [Jon Favreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Favreau "Jon Favreau"), [Harold Ramis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ramis "Harold Ramis"), [Jason Reitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Reitman "Jason Reitman"), and [Marc Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Webb "Marc Webb").[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-prolific-11) Episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including [Steve Carell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell "Steve Carell"), [John Krasinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski "John Krasinski"), [Rainn Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson "Rainn Wilson"), [Ed Helms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Helms "Ed Helms"), and [Brian Baumgartner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Baumgartner "Brian Baumgartner").[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-prolific-11)

### Development and writing

Prior to the second episode airing, the writers spent time conducting research in offices.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-danielsinterview1-19) This process was used for Daniels' other series _[King of the Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill "King of the Hill")_ and _[Parks and Recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation "Parks and Recreation")_.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-danielsinterview1-19) The [pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot "Television pilot") is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the original British series.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-danielsinterview2-20) Daniels chose to go this route because "completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do" owing to the show being an adaptation.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-danielsinterview2-20) He had briefly considered using the idea for "[The Dundies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dundies "The Dundies")" as the pilot episode.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-danielscommentary-21) After the writers knew who the cast was, they were allowed to write for the actors, which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode, "[Diversity Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_Day_(The_Office) "Diversity Day (The Office)")".[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-danielsinterview2-20) Following the mixed reaction toward the first season, the writers attempted to make the series more "optimistic" and to make [Michael Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office) "Michael Scott (The Office)") more likable.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-novakcommentary-22) They also established the supporting characters of the series more, giving them relatable personalities. They also made the lights in the office brighter, which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the British series.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-novakcommentary-22)

A common problem with the scripts, according to [Novak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Novak "B. J. Novak"), is that they tended to run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-tableread-23) For example, the script for the episode "[Search Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_Committee "Search Committee")" was initially 75 pages, which was 10 pages too long.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-tableread-23) A complete script was written for each episode; however, actors were given opportunities to improvise during filming. Fischer said, "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything down on paper. But we get to play around a little bit, too. Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers."[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-24) These [improvisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation "Improvisation") lead to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of _The Office_, all of which are considered part of the show's [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction) "Canon (fiction)") and storyline by Daniels.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-deletedscenes-25) Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the [bonus footage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleted_scene "Deleted scene"). In an experiment, a deleted scene from "[The Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_(The_Office) "The Return (The Office)")" was made available over [NBC.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC.com "NBC.com") and [iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store "ITunes Store"), explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-deletedscenes-25) Daniels hoped that [word of mouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth "Word of mouth") among fans would spread the information, but he eventually considered the experiment a failure.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-deletedscenes-25)

### Casting

According to [Jenna Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer "Jenna Fischer"), the series used an unusual casting process that did not involve a script. The producers would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Fresh_Air_with_Terry_Gross-26) NBC programmer [Kevin Reilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Reilly_(executive) "Kevin Reilly (executive)") originally suggested [Paul Giamatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Giamatti "Paul Giamatti") to producer [Ben Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Silverman "Ben Silverman") for the role of Michael Scott, but the actor declined. [Martin Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Short "Martin Short"), [Hank Azaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Azaria "Hank Azaria"), and [Bob Odenkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Odenkirk "Bob Odenkirk") were reported to be interested in the part.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-27) In January 2004 _[Variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine) "Variety (magazine)")_ reported that [Steve Carell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell "Steve Carell"), of the [Comedy Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central "Comedy Central") program _[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show "The Daily Show")_, was in talks to play the role. At the time, he was already committed to another NBC midseason replacement comedy, _[Come to Papa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_to_Papa_(TV_series) "Come to Papa (TV series)")_,[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-28) but the series was quickly canceled, allowing his full commitment to _The Office_. Carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the British series before he auditioned. He did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying Gervais' characterizations.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-29) Other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included [Ben Falcone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Falcone "Ben Falcone"), [Alan Tudyk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Tudyk "Alan Tudyk"), [Jim Zulevic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Zulevic "Jim Zulevic"), and [Paul F. Tompkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_F._Tompkins "Paul F. Tompkins"). [Rainn Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson "Rainn Wilson") was cast as power-hungry [sycophant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycophant "Sycophant") [Dwight Schrute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Schrute "Dwight Schrute"), and he watched every episode of the British series before he auditioned.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-wilsoncommentary-30) Wilson had originally auditioned for Michael, a performance that he described as a "terrible [Ricky Gervais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais "Ricky Gervais") impersonation"; however, the casting directors liked his audition as Dwight much more and hired him. [Seth Rogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rogen "Seth Rogen"), [Matt Besser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Besser "Matt Besser"), [Patton Oswalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_Oswalt "Patton Oswalt"), and [Judah Friedlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Friedlander "Judah Friedlander") also auditioned for the role.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-wilsoncommentary-30)

[John Krasinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski "John Krasinski") _(left)_ and [Jenna Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer "Jenna Fischer") _(right)_ were cast as the "will-they-won't-they" couple Jim and Pam. Both of them were relatively unknown before the show's airing.

[John Krasinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski "John Krasinski") and [Jenna Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer "Jenna Fischer") were cast in their respective roles as Jim and Pam, the central love interests. Krasinski had attended school with [B. J. Novak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Novak "B. J. Novak"), and the two were friends.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-32) Fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible, creating the original Pam hairstyle.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-33) In an interview on [NPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR "NPR")'s _[Fresh Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Air "Fresh Air")_, Fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for Pam and Jim, with the producers partnering the different potential Pams and Jims (four of each) together to gauge their chemistry. When Fischer finished her scene with Krasinski, he told her that she was his favorite Pam, to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite Jim.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Fresh_Air_with_Terry_Gross-26) [Adam Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(actor) "Adam Scott (actor)") and [John Cho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cho "John Cho") both auditioned for the role of Jim, and [Kathryn Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Hahn "Kathryn Hahn") also auditioned for the role of Pam.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-34)

The supporting cast includes actors known for their [improv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre "Improvisational theatre") work: [Angela Kinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Kinsey "Angela Kinsey"), [Kate Flannery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Flannery "Kate Flannery"), [Oscar Nunez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Nunez "Oscar Nunez"), [Leslie David Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_David_Baker "Leslie David Baker"), [Brian Baumgartner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Baumgartner "Brian Baumgartner"), [Melora Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melora_Hardin "Melora Hardin"), and [David Denman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Denman "David Denman").[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Chunp5-35) Kinsey had originally auditioned for Pam. The producers thought she was "too feisty" for the character, but they called her back for the part of [Angela Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Martin "Angela Martin"), which she won.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-36) Flannery first auditioned for the part of Jan Levinson-Gould, before landing the role of Meredith Palmer.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-37) Baumgartner originally auditioned for Stanley, but was eventually cast as Kevin.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-38) [Ken Kwapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kwapis "Ken Kwapis"), the director of the pilot episode, liked the way [Phyllis Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Smith "Phyllis Smith"), a casting associate, read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as [Phyllis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Lapin-Vance "Phyllis Lapin-Vance").[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Wolk-39) At the beginning of the third season, [Ed Helms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Helms "Ed Helms") and [Rashida Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Jones "Rashida Jones") joined the cast as members of Dunder Mifflin Stamford. While Jones would later leave the cast for a role on _[Parks and Recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation "Parks and Recreation")_, in February 2007, NBC announced that Helms was being promoted to a series regular.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-40)

Four of the show's writers have also performed in front of the camera. B. J. Novak was cast as reluctant temp [Ryan Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Howard_(The_Office) "Ryan Howard (The Office)") after Daniels saw his [stand-up act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy "Stand-up comedy"). [Paul Lieberstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lieberstein "Paul Lieberstein") was cast as [human resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources "Human resources") director [Toby Flenderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Flenderson "Toby Flenderson") on Novak's suggestion after his cold readings of scripts.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Chunp5-35) Greg Daniels was originally unsure where to use [Mindy Kaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindy_Kaling "Mindy Kaling") on-screen in the series until the opportunity came in the script for the second episode, "[Diversity Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_Day_(The_Office) "Diversity Day (The Office)")", where Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. "Since \[that slap\], I've been on the show" (as [Kelly Kapoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Kapoor "Kelly Kapoor")), says Kaling.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Wolk-39) [Michael Schur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schur "Michael Schur") has also made occasional appearances as Dwight's cousin [Mose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mose_Schrute "Mose Schrute"), and consulting producer [Larry Wilmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wilmore "Larry Wilmore") has played [diversity trainer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_training "Diversity training") [Mr. Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Office_(American_TV_series)_characters#Mr._Brown "List of The Office (American TV series) characters"). Plans were made for [Mackenzie Crook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_Crook "Mackenzie Crook"), [Martin Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Freeman "Martin Freeman"), and [Lucy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Davis "Lucy Davis"), from the British series, to appear in the third season,[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-41) but those plans were scrapped due to scheduling conflicts.[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-42)[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-43)

_The Office_ was filmed with a [single-camera setup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-camera_setup "Single-camera setup") in a [cinéma vérité](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cin%C3%A9ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9 "Cinéma vérité") allowing the look of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track, allowing its "deadpan" and "absurd" humor to fully come across.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-mockumentaryformat-44) The primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film [Dunder Mifflin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin "Dunder Mifflin") and its employees, seemingly around the clock.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-mockumentaryformat-44) The presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters, especially Michael Scott, who enthusiastically participates in the filming.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-format2-45) The characters, especially Jim and Pam, also look towards the camera when Michael creates an awkward situation.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Fresh_Air_with_Terry_Gross-26) The main action of the show is supplemented with talking-head interviews or "confessionals" in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the day's events.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Fresh_Air_with_Terry_Gross-26) Actor [John Krasinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski "John Krasinski") shot the footage of Scranton for the opening credits after he found out he was cast as Jim. He visited Scranton for research and interviewed employees at actual paper companies.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-46)

In order to get the feel of an actual documentary, the producers hired cinematographer [Randall Einhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Einhorn "Randall Einhorn"), who is known for directing episodes of _[Survivor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) "Survivor (American TV series)")_, which allowed the show to have the feel of "rough and jumpy" like an actual documentary.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-format2-45) According to producer [Michael Schur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schur "Michael Schur"), the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-schurinterview-47) The producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-schurinterview-47) For example, in the fourth-season episode "[Did I Stutter?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Did_I_Stutter%3F "Did I Stutter?")," a scene featured Michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom and not pass by Stanley. The producers debated whether that was possible and Einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-schurinterview-47) Despite the strict nature in the early years of the series, later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format, with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not, which also changed the writing and comedy style of the series.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-igneightcomments-48) This inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-igneightcomments-48)[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-avclub-49)

When it came to choosing the theme song for _The Office_, producer Greg Daniels had several tracks he was thinking of using:[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-IndieWiretheme-50) existing songs including "[Better Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Things_(song) "Better Things (song)")" by [The Kinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kinks "The Kinks"), "[Float On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_On_(Modest_Mouse_song) "Float On (Modest Mouse song)")" by [Modest Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modest_Mouse "Modest Mouse"), and "[Mr. Blue Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Blue_Sky "Mr. Blue Sky")" by [Electric Light Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra "Electric Light Orchestra"),[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-EWthemesong-51) and several original pieces artists contributed to the producers via a [cattle call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_call "Cattle call").[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-BMI-52) Daniels decided that the cast would vote on what song to use and gave them four of the choices.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-IndieWiretheme-50) Most of them wanted "Mr. Blue Sky," but that option turned out to be invalid as it was already used in the drama series _[LAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAX_(TV_series) "LAX (TV series)")_ (2004–2005).[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-EWthemesong-51) Thus, the final choice was an original track written by [Jay Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Ferguson_(American_musician) "Jay Ferguson (American musician)") and performed by The Scrantones.[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Scrantones-53)

The theme is played over the title sequence, which features scenes of Scranton, various tasks around the office and the main cast members. Some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song. Starting with the fourth season, the theme song is played over the [closing credits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_credits "Closing credits"), which previously rolled in silence. The exteriors of buildings in the title sequence are actual buildings in [Scranton, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania "Scranton, Pennsylvania"), and were shot by cast member John Krasinski.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Scranton_NYT_story-54) Ferguson described his theme as "against type; it has this vulnerability, this yearning to it that soon explodes into this overdone optimism which then gets crushed - which is pretty much what the show is about."[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-BMI-52)

The [mockumentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary "Mockumentary") format of the show contains no [laugh track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track "Laugh track"), and most of the music is [diegetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegesis "Diegesis"), with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios, computers, or other devices.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Music-55) However, songs have been played during montages or the closing credits, such as "[Tiny Dancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Dancer "Tiny Dancer")" by [Elton John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John "Elton John") ("[The Dundies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dundies "The Dundies")") and "[Islands in the Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands_in_the_Stream_(song) "Islands in the Stream (song)")" by [Kenny Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Rogers "Kenny Rogers") and [Dolly Parton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton "Dolly Parton") ("[E-mail Surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_Surveillance "E-mail Surveillance")").[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-danielscommentary-21) Featured music tends to be well known, and often songs reflect the character, such as Michael's attempt to seem hip by using "[Mambo No. 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambo_No._5 "Mambo No. 5")" and later "[My Humps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Humps "My Humps")" as his cell phone ringtone.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Music-55) Daniels has said that it does not count as [film score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score "Film score") as long as it already appeared in the episode.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-danielscommentary-21)

_The Office_ employs an [ensemble cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast "Ensemble cast"). Many characters portrayed by _The Office_ cast are based on the original British series. While these characters generally have the same attitude and perceptions as their British counterparts, the roles have been redesigned to better fit the American show. The show is known for its relatively large cast size, with many of its actors and actresses known particularly for their [improvisational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation "Improvisation") work. [Steve Carell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell "Steve Carell") stars as [Michael Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office) "Michael Scott (The Office)"), regional manager of the [Dunder Mifflin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin "Dunder Mifflin") Scranton Branch. Loosely based on [David Brent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brent "David Brent"), Gervais' character in the British series, Scott is a well-intentioned man whose attempts at humor, while seemingly innocent to himself, often offend and annoy his peers and employees, and in some situations lead to reprimanding from his superiors. [Rainn Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson "Rainn Wilson") portrays [Dwight Schrute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Schrute "Dwight Schrute"), based upon [Gareth Keenan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Keenan "Gareth Keenan"), who is a salesman and the assistant to the regional manager, a fictional title created by Michael.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-56) [John Krasinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski "John Krasinski") portrays [Jim Halpert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Halpert "Jim Halpert"), a salesman and, in later seasons, assistant manager or co-manager who is known for his wittiness and his practical jokes on Dwight (often accompanied by [Pam Beesly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Beesly "Pam Beesly")). Halpert is based upon [Tim Canterbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Canterbury "Tim Canterbury") and, at the start of the series, is known to have feelings for Pam, the receptionist, who is engaged to a fellow employee.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-57) Pam, played by [Jenna Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer "Jenna Fischer"), is based on [Dawn Tinsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Tinsley "Dawn Tinsley"). She is shy, but in many cases a cohort with Jim in his pranks on Dwight.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-58) [B. J. Novak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Novak "B. J. Novak") portrays [Ryan Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Howard_(The_Office) "Ryan Howard (The Office)"), who for the first two seasons is a [temporary worker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_work "Temporary work") but is promoted to sales representative in the [third season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_season_3) "The Office (American season 3)"). He later ascends to the position of vice president, North East Region, and director of new media until his innovations are exposed as corporate fraud, and he is fired. He then gets a job in a bowling alley and later briefly works for the Michael Scott Paper Company. After this, and a stint in rehab, he again eventually ends up as a temporary worker at the Scranton branch.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-59)

The accounting department includes [Angela Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Martin "Angela Martin") ([Angela Kinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Kinsey "Angela Kinsey")), an uptight and judgmental woman who likes to keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as business-like as possible; [Kevin Malone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Malone "Kevin Malone") ([Brian Baumgartner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Baumgartner "Brian Baumgartner")), a lovable but dim-witted man who revels in juvenile humor and frequently indulges in gambling; and [Oscar Martinez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Martinez_(The_Office) "Oscar Martinez (The Office)") ([Oscar Nuñez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Nu%C3%B1ez "Oscar Nuñez")), who is intelligent and cultured, but often patronizing, and whose [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality") and Hispanic heritage made him a frequent target for Michael's unintentional off-color comments. Rounding out the office are the laconic salesman [Stanley Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Hudson "Stanley Hudson") ([Leslie David Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_David_Baker "Leslie David Baker")), who cannot stand Michael's constant references to his [Black American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American "African American") heritage (he also doesn't like to take part in time-wasting meetings and often works on crossword puzzles or sleeps during them); eccentric [quality assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance "Quality assurance") representative [Creed Bratton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_Bratton_(character) "Creed Bratton (character)") ([Creed Bratton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_Bratton "Creed Bratton")); the shy and matronly saleswoman [Phyllis Lapin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Lapin "Phyllis Lapin") ([Phyllis Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Smith "Phyllis Smith")), who dates and then marries Bob Vance ([Robert R.

Toward the end of season five, the bubbly and naive [Erin Hannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Hannon "Erin Hannon") ([Ellie Kemper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellie_Kemper "Ellie Kemper")) is introduced as Pam's replacement at reception following Pam's short stint at the Michael Scott Paper Company and subsequent move to sales. A story arc at the end of season four has [Holly Flax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Flax "Holly Flax") ([Amy Ryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ryan "Amy Ryan")) transferred to the office as Toby's replacement. She becomes a love interest for Michael, as they share very similar personality traits. [Jo Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Bennett "Jo Bennett") ([Kathy Bates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Bates "Kathy Bates")) is the CEO of Sabre, a company that takes over Dunder Mifflin, and [Gabe Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Lewis "Gabe Lewis") ([Zach Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Woods "Zach Woods")), introduced in the middle of season six, is a Sabre employee who is assigned to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch as the regional director of sales. In season seven, Bennett's friend [Nellie Bertram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Bertram "Nellie Bertram") ([Catherine Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Tate "Catherine Tate")) is interviewed to replace Scott, and later serves as a replacement regional manager for Bernard in season eight.

Clark is later moved to sales.

Initially the actors who portray the supporting office workers were credited as [guest stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_stars "Guest stars"), but then were named series regulars during the second season.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Brooks-60) The show's large ensemble was mainly praised by critics and led to the series winning two [Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Award_for_Outstanding_Performance_by_an_Ensemble_in_a_Comedy_Series "Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series").[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-sagcast-61) Carell was reportedly paid $175,000 per episode starting in the third season.[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-paycheck-62) Krasinski and Fischer were paid around $20,000 at the beginning of the series.[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-paycheck-62) Starting with the fourth season, the two were paid around $100,000 per episode.[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-paycheck-62)

A typical episode for a half-hour time slot runs 20-1/2 minutes.[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-63) The final episode of season two introduced the first of what would be several "super-sized" episodes that had an approximately 28-minute running time for a 40-minute time slot.[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-64) Season three introduced the first of an occasional hour-long episodes (approximately 42-minute running time, also suitable for being shown as two separate normal episodes in reruns).[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-65)

The first season consists of six episodes.

The series starts by introducing Dunder Mifflin's employees via a tour given by branch manager Michael Scott for both a documentary camera crew and first-day temp Ryan Howard.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Pilot-66) The audience learns that salesman Jim Halpert has a crush on receptionist Pam Beesly, who helps him play pranks on co-worker Dwight Schrute, even though she is engaged to Roy, who works in the company's downstairs warehouse. Rumors spread throughout the office that Dunder Mifflin's corporate headquarters is planning to downsize an entire branch, leading to general anxiety, but Michael chooses to deny or downplay the realities of the situation in order to maintain employee morale.

The second season is the series' first 22-episode season, and has its first 28-minute "super-sized" episode.

Many workers seen in the background of the first season are developed into secondary characters, and romantic relationships begin to develop between some of them. Michael makes out with and then spends the night with his boss, Jan Levinson, but does not have sex with her.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-The_Client-67) Dwight and Angela become romantically involved,[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-E-mail_Surveillance-68) but keep their relationship a secret. Kelly develops a crush on Ryan, and they start dating off and on. When Roy finally agrees to set a date for his wedding to Pam,[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Booze_Cruise-69) at a company booze cruise, Jim grows depressed and considers transferring to the [Stamford, Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford,_Connecticut "Stamford, Connecticut") branch, but tells Pam in the [season finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_Night "Casino Night") that he is in love with her. Even though Pam insists she is with Roy, the two kiss, and Jim transfers to the Stamford branch soon after.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Casino_Night-70) The general threat of downsizing continues throughout the season as well.

The third season consists of 17 half-hour episodes, four 40-minute "super-sized" episodes, and two one-hour episodes.

The season starts with a brief flashback to (and additional footage from) the last episode of season 2, "Casino Night", when Jim kissed Pam and confessed his feelings for her. Jim briefly transfers to Dunder Mifflin's [Stamford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford,_Connecticut "Stamford, Connecticut") branch after Pam confirms her commitment to Roy. Corporate is later forced to merge the Stamford branch with the Scranton branch.[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Branch_Closing-71) Michael takes this merger very seriously. Transferred to the Scranton branch are saleswoman [Karen Filippelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Filippelli "Karen Filippelli"), whom Jim has begun dating, and the anger-prone preppy salesman [Andy Bernard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bernard "Andy Bernard"), along with other Stamford employees who all eventually quit within the first few episodes of being there. Pam is newly single after calling off her marriage to Roy, and Jim's unresolved feelings for her and his new relationship with Karen lead to shifting tensions amongst the three. Meanwhile, Michael and Jan's relationship escalates, which causes them both to behave erratically on the job. On the other hand, Dwight and Angela continue their steamy secret relationship. In [the season's finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Job_(The_Office) "The Job (The Office)"), Jim, Karen, and Michael interview for a corporate position that turns out to be Jan's, who is fired for poor performance. Jim is offered the job but rejects it off-screen,[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Launch_Party-72) opting instead to remain in Scranton without Karen and ask Pam out on a date, which she joyfully accepts. In the final scene, we learn Ryan has been awarded Jan's job.[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-The_Job-73)

NBC ordered a full fourth season of thirty half-hour episodes, but ended with only 19 due to a halt in production caused by the [2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike "2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike").[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-74)[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-75) The season consists of nine half-hour and five hour-long episodes for a total of 19 episodes of material created.

Karen has left the Scranton branch after her breakup with Jim and becomes regional manager at the [Utica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York "Utica, New York") branch.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Branch_Wars-76)[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Dunder_Mifflin_Infinity-77) A self-employed Jan moves herself and her candle business into Michael's condo, until the dissolution of their relationship midway through the season during an intimate dinner party including Pam, Jim, Andy, Angela and Dwight. After Dwight's crude (though well-intentioned) method of [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia "Animal euthanasia") of Angela's ailing cat without her permission,[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Fun_Run-78) she leaves him for Andy, leading Dwight into depression. Ryan, in his new corporate life in New York City, attempts to modernize Dunder Mifflin with a new website for online sales; he also learns that his boss, [David Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wallace_(The_Office) "David Wallace (The Office)"), favors Jim, and thus Ryan attempts to sabotage Jim's career. Ryan is soon arrested and fired for misleading the shareholders and committing fraud related to the website's sales numbers. Toby announces he is moving to [Costa Rica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica "Costa Rica") and is replaced by [Holly Flax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Flax "Holly Flax"), who quickly shows a liking for Michael. Pam decides to follow her artistic interests and attends a three-month graphic design course at the [Pratt Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_Institute "Pratt Institute") in New York City. In the season finale, Jim almost proposes to Pam, but is interrupted by Andy proposing to Angela, who reluctantly agrees. Phyllis then catches Dwight and Angela having sex in the office.[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-79)

The fifth season consists of 28 half-hours of material, divided into 24 half-hour episodes and two hour-long episodes, one of which aired after [Super Bowl XLIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIII "Super Bowl XLIII").[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-80)

Jim proposes to Pam at a gas station midway between Scranton and New York City where they are meeting for a visit. Pam ultimately returns from New York to Scranton, where Jim has bought his parents' house for the two of them. Having avoided jail and only been sentenced to community service, Ryan bleaches his hair and starts working at a bowling alley. Michael initiates a romance with Holly until she is transferred to the [Nashua, New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashua,_New_Hampshire "Nashua, New Hampshire"), branch and their relationship ends. When Andy is made aware of Dwight and Angela's continued affair, both men leave her.[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-The_Duel-81) Newly hired Vice President [Charles Miner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Miner_(The_Office) "Charles Miner (The Office)") implements a rigid managerial style over the branch that causes Michael to resign in protest.[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-New_Boss-82) Michael opens the [Michael Scott Paper Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_Paper_Company "Michael Scott Paper Company") in the same office building, enticing Pam and Ryan to join as salespeople, and though his business model is ultimately unsustainable, Dunder Mifflin's profits are immediately threatened.[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Broke-83) In a [buyout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyout "Buyout") of the Michael Scott Paper Company, the three are rehired with Pam promoted to sales and Ryan returning as a temp. During the chaos, new receptionist [Erin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Hannon "Erin Hannon") is hired to fill the vacancy originally left by Pam. The season ends with a scene that subtly alludes to Pam's (unplanned) pregnancy.

The sixth season consists of 26 half-hours of material, divided into 22 half-hour episodes and two hour-long episodes.

Jim is promoted as co-manager. Rumors of bankruptcy begin to surround Dunder Mifflin, and by Christmas, Wallace announces to the branch that Dunder Mifflin has accepted a buyout from Sabre Corporation, a printer company.

In the [season finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower_(The_Office) "Whistleblower (The Office)"), Dwight buys the office park. Michael agrees to make an announcement to the press regarding a case of faulty printers.

The seventh season consists of 26 half-hours of material, divided into 21 half-hour episodes, one "super-sized" episode, and two hour-long episodes.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-86)

This was the final season for [Steve Carell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell "Steve Carell"), who plays [Michael Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office) "Michael Scott (The Office)"), as Carell wanted to move on after his contract expired during this season.[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-carelldepature-87) Beginning with this season, [Zach Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Woods "Zach Woods"), who portrays [Gabe Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Lewis "Gabe Lewis"), was promoted to a series regular.[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-88) Erin and Gabe have begun a relationship, much to Andy's chagrin, and Andy attempts to win Erin's affection back. Michael's former girlfriend, Holly, returns to Scranton to fill in for Toby who is on jury duty for the "Scranton Strangler" trial. Michael and Holly eventually restart their relationship. After the two get engaged, Michael reveals he will be leaving Scranton to move to Colorado with Holly in order to support her elderly parents. Angela starts dating state senator [Robert Lipton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lipton "Robert Lipton"), while Pam and Jim adjust to parenthood. After Michael's replacement ([Will Ferrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell "Will Ferrell")) is seriously injured on the job, Jo creates a search committee to interview candidates and choose a new manager for the office. In the meantime, Dwight Schrute takes over as acting Manager.

The eighth season consists of 24 episodes.

[James Spader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Spader "James Spader") joins the cast as [Robert California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_California "Robert California"), the new CEO of Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-89) Andy is then promoted to regional manager and works hard to make a good impression on Robert, asking Dwight to be his number two.[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-hitfixthelist-90) Pam and Jim are expecting their second child, Phillip, at the start of the season, to coincide with Fischer's real-life pregnancy.[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-CecesSibling-91) Angela is also pregnant with her first son, also named Philip, with State Senator Robert Lipton (although it is implied that [Dwight Schrute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Schrute "Dwight Schrute") is actually the child's biological father). Darryl starts falling for new warehouse foreman, Val.[\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Mrs._California-92) Dwight is tasked with traveling to [Tallahassee, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida "Tallahassee, Florida"), to assist Sabre special projects manager [Nellie Bertram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Bertram "Nellie Bertram") ([Catherine Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Tate "Catherine Tate")) in launching a chain of retail stores, along with Jim, Ryan, Stanley, Erin, and new office temp [Cathy Simms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Office_(American_TV_series)_characters#Cathy_Simms "List of The Office (American TV series) characters"). Cathy is also revealed to have ulterior motives for the trip, as she intends to seduce Jim, but fails.[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Special_Project-93) Robert later kills the retail store project, and Erin decides to stay in Florida as an elderly woman's live-in helper. Andy goes to Florida to win back Erin, allowing Nellie to claim the manager position as her own. Robert tells Andy that he has been demoted back to a salesman, but Andy refuses to accept the news, which causes him to be fired. Andy becomes motivated to begin a Dunder Mifflin comeback and joins with former CFO David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre, putting Sabre completely out of business and giving Andy the manager position once again.

The final season consists of 25 episodes.

Andy, recently returning from Outward Bound manager training, reverts to his arrogant earlier season personality, abandoning both Erin and the office to travel around the Caribbean with his brother in their sailboat after the demise of his parents' relationship. In his absence, Erin strikes up a romance with new customer service rep Pete, who, along with other new customer service rep Clark, replaces Kelly, who leaves for Ohio with her new husband. (Ryan also moves to Ohio for "unrelated reasons.")

Meanwhile, Jim receives an exciting opportunity from an old college friend who offers him a job at Athlead, a sports marketing company based in Philadelphia. Darryl also jumps on board, but the distance and dedication to Athlead hurts Jim's relationship with Pam.

Angela must deal with her husband's infidelity with Oscar. She also deals with her lingering attraction to Dwight, who inherits his family's beet farm. Dwight receives more good news when David Wallace handpicks him to be the new manager after Andy quits to pursue an acting career, which quickly ends when he embarrasses himself at an [American Idol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol "American Idol")\-like [a cappella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_cappella "A cappella") singing competition that turns into a viral web sensation. Dwight later makes Jim his assistant to the regional manager, and the two officially end their grudge.

After Jim reconciles with Pam, choosing to stay in Scranton over Philadelphia, Dwight professes his love for Angela and finally marries her. In the series finale, which takes place one year after the release of the documentary that has been shot during the entire series, the employees reunite for Dwight and Angela's wedding, for which Michael returns to serve as the best man (with help from Jim who was the person Dwight first asked to be best man).

## Reception and legacy

### Critical reviews and commentary

Before the show aired, Ricky Gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers.[\[104\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-104) The first season of _The Office_ was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the short-lived NBC series _[Coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(American_TV_series) "Coupling (American TV series)")_, which was also based on a [British version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(British_TV_series) "Coupling (British TV series)").[\[105\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-105)[\[106\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-washingtonpost-106) The _[New York Daily News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_News_(New_York) "Daily News (New York)")_ called it "so diluted there's little left but muddy water," and _[USA Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today "USA Today")_ called it a "passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original."[\[107\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Timms-107) A _[Guardian Unlimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Unlimited "Guardian Unlimited")_ review panned its lack of originality, stating that Steve Carell "just seems to be trying too hard.... Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own. But right now he's a pale imitation."[\[108\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-108) [Tom Shales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Shales "Tom Shales") of _[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")_ said it was "not the mishmash that \[the Americanized version of _Coupling_\] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, like when the copying machine is just about to give out."[\[106\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-washingtonpost-106)

"_The Office_ has one of the best casts on television.... It also has created several compelling characters and touching relationships, all of which is fairly remarkable for a half-hour comedy."

—Travis Fickett of [IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN "IGN") in June 2007[\[109\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-109)

The second season was better received. [James Poniewozik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Poniewozik "James Poniewozik") of _[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_ remarked, "Producer Greg Daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly American work conventions ... with a tone that's more satiric and less mordant.... The new boss is different from the old boss, and that's fine by me."[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-time06-110) He named it the second best TV show of 2006 after _[Battlestar Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series) "Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)")_.[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-time06-110) _[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")_ writer [Mark Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Harris_(journalist) "Mark Harris (journalist)") echoed these sentiments a week later, stating, "Thanks to the fearless Steve Carell, an ever-stronger supporting cast, and scripts that spew American corporate absurdist vernacular with perfect pitch, this undervalued remake does the near impossible—it honors Ricky Gervais' original and works on its own terms."[\[111\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-111) _[The A.V. Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A.V._Club "The A.V. Club")_ reviewer Nathan Rabin expressed its views on the show's progression: "After a rocky start, _The Office_ improved immeasurably, instantly becoming one of TV's funniest, sharpest shows. The casting of Steve Carell in the Gervais role proved to be a masterstroke. The American _Office_ is that rarest of anomalies: a remake of a classic show that both does right by its source and carves out its own strong identity."[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-112)

The series has been included on several top TV series lists. The show placed #61 on _[Entertainment Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")_'s "New TV Classics" list.[\[113\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-113) _Time'_s [James Poniewozik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Poniewozik "James Poniewozik") named it the second-best TV series of 2006,[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-time06-110) and the sixth-best returning series of 2007, out of ten TV series.[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-114) He also included it on his "The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME" list.[\[115\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Time_100_best-115) The show was also named the best show of 2006 by [BuddyTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuddyTV "BuddyTV").[\[116\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-116) while _[Paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paste_(magazine) "Paste (magazine)")_ named it the sixth-best sitcom of 2010.[\[117\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-117) In 2013 the [Writers Guild of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America "Writers Guild of America") placed it at #66 on their list of _101 Best Written TV Series_.[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-118) In 2019, the series was ranked 32nd on _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_'s list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.[\[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-119)

The show has some superficial similarities to the comic strip _[Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert "Dilbert")_, which also features employees coping with an inept superior. John Spector, CEO of The Conference Board, says that they both show the impact a leader can have, for good or bad. Dilbert creator [Scott Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams "Scott Adams") also touts the similarities: "The lesson from _The Office_ and from _Dilbert_ is that people are often dysfunctional, and no amount of training can fix it."[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-USA_Today-120) A [labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_labor "Organized labor")\-affiliated group praised the second-season episode "[Boys and Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_and_Girls_(The_Office) "Boys and Girls (The Office)")" for what it considered an unusually frank depiction of [union busting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_busting "Union busting") on American television.[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-union-busting-121) [Metacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), a review aggregation website, graded only the first, third, sixth, and final seasons. However, it denoted that all four of them received "generally favorable reviews" from critics, awarding a 61, 85, 78, and 64 score—out of 100—to each of them, respectively.[\[122\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-122)[\[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-123)[\[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-124)[\[125\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-meta-125) It later named it the thirteenth most mentioned series on "Best of Decade" top-ten lists.[\[126\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-126)

"_The Office_ now is a pale, listless shadow of what it used to be."

The last few seasons were criticized for a dip in quality. The sixth season received criticisms for a lack of stakes for the characters.[\[128\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-128)[\[129\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-129)[\[130\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-130) Other critics and fans have also criticized the dragging out of the Jim and Pam romance.[\[131\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-131) _The Office_ co-creator [Ricky Gervais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais "Ricky Gervais") wrote in his blog, referring to "[Search Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_Committee "Search Committee")," particularly [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett "Warren Buffett")'s guest appearance, "If you're going to jump a shark, jump a big one," and compared the episode to the [Chris Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin "Chris Martin") episode of Gervais' other series, _[Extras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extras_(TV_series) "Extras (TV series)")_ (although he later said on his website, "I fucking didn't \[diss _The Office_\], that's for sure").[\[132\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-gervais-132) Some critics said the series should have ended after the departure of Steve Carell.[\[133\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-133)[\[134\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-134) In an [IAmA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAmA "IAmA") interview on [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit "Reddit"), Rainn Wilson felt that the eighth season possessed some mistakes "creatively," such as the chemistry between Spader and Helms, which he called "a bit dark" and argued that the show should have gone for a "brighter and more energized" relationship.[\[135\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-ama-135) Despite this, there are later-series episodes that have received critical acclaim, including "[Stress Relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_Relief_(The_Office) "Stress Relief (The Office)"),"[\[136\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-136) "[Niagara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_(The_Office) "Niagara (The Office)")",[\[137\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-137) "[Garage Sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_Sale_(The_Office) "Garage Sale (The Office)")",[\[138\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-garagesale-138) "[Goodbye, Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael "Goodbye, Michael")",[\[139\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-goodbyemichael-139) "[Dwight Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Christmas "Dwight Christmas")",[\[140\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-dwightchristmas-140) "[A.A.R.M.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.A.R.M.

### Ratings

Premiering on Thursday, March 24, 2005, after an episode of _[The Apprentice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series) "The Apprentice (American TV series)")_ on NBC, _The Office_ brought in 11.2 million viewers in the U.S., winning its time slot.[\[107\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Timms-107) When NBC moved the series to its intended Tuesday night slot, it lost nearly half its audience with only 5.9 million viewers.[\[149\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-149) The program averaged 5.4 million viewers, ranking it #102 for the 2004–05 U.S. television season.[\[150\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-150) "[Hot Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Girl_(The_Office) "Hot Girl (The Office)")," the first season's [finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_finale "Season finale"), rated a 2.2 with a 10 [audience measurement share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_measurement "Audience measurement"). Episodes were also rerun on [CNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC "CNBC").[\[151\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-151)

As the second season started, the success of Carell's hit summer movie _[The 40-Year-Old Virgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_40-Year-Old_Virgin "The 40-Year-Old Virgin")_ and online sales of episodes at [iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes "ITunes") helped the show.[\[152\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-152) The increase in viewership led NBC to move the series to the "[Must See TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Must_See_TV "Must See TV")" Thursday night in January 2006, where ratings continued to grow. By the 2005–06 season, it placed #67 (tied with _[20/20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20/20_(American_TV_program) "20/20 (American TV program)")_). It averaged 8 million viewers with a 4.0/10 rating/share among viewers ages 18–49, and was up 80% in viewers from the year before and up 60% in viewers ages 18–49.[\[153\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-153) The series ranked as NBC's highest rated scripted series during its run.[\[154\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-154) The highest rated episode of the series was "[Stress Relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_Relief_(The_Office) "Stress Relief (The Office)")," which was watched by 22.9 million viewers. This episode was aired right after [Super Bowl XLIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIII "Super Bowl XLIII").[\[155\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Ratings1-155) While later seasons dropped in the ratings, the show was still one of NBC's highest rated shows, and in October 2011 it was reported that it cost $178,840 per 30-second commercial, the most for any NBC scripted series.[\[156\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-156)

As of December 2018, the series is one of most popular shows on Netflix, with its availability on a streamer leading to the show's sustained popularity.[\[191\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-191) _The Office_ will leave Netflix in 2021, as NBCUniversal acquired the rights to the show for its upcoming streaming service.[\[192\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-192)[\[193\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Netflix_NBC-193)

On December 13, 2017, [Comedy Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central "Comedy Central") announced that they had acquired all nine seasons of the show from NBCUniversal in a non-exclusive deal, and some episodes are available to stream on Comedy Central's official website and [mobile app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app "Mobile app") on a rotating basis.[\[194\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-194)

When the show was in production, it was noted for its large amount of delayed viewing. Of the 12.4 million total viewings of "[Fun Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_Run "Fun Run")", the fourth season's premiere, 2.7 million, or 22%, were on a computer via online streaming. "_The Office_", said _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_, "is on the leading edge of a sharp shift in entertainment viewing that was thought to be years away: watching television episodes on a computer screen is now a common activity for millions of consumers." It was particularly popular with online viewers, an NBC researcher said, because as an episode-driven sitcom without special effects it was easy to watch on smaller monitors such as those found on [laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop "Laptop") and [iPods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod "IPod").[\[195\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Small_screens-195) Between the online viewings and those who use [digital video recorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder "Digital video recorder"), 25–50% of the show's viewers [watched it after its scheduled airtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_shifting "Time shifting").[\[196\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-timeshifting_viewers-196)

The show's Internet success became an issue in the [2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike "2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike"). Daniels and many of the cast members who double as writers posted a video to [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") shortly after the strike began, pointing out how little, if any, they received in [residuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(entertainment_industry) "Residual (entertainment industry)") from online and DVD viewing. "You're watching this on the Internet, a thing that pays us zero dollars," Schur said. "We're supposed to get 11 cents for every two trillion downloads." The writers were particularly upset that they weren't compensated for the [Daytime Emmy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award "Daytime Emmy Award")\-winning summer webisodes "The Accountants", which NBC considered promotional material despite the embedded [commercials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement "Television advertisement").[\[197\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-197)

### Promotional

The show's success has resulted in expansion outside of television. Characters have appeared in promotional materials for NBC, and a licensed video game—_[The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(video_game) "The Office (video game)")_—was released in 2007.[\[198\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-198)[\[199\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-199) In 2008 two games were introduced via Pressman Toy Corp: _The Office_ Trivia Board Game and _The Office_ DVD Board Game.[\[200\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-200) In 2009, _The Office_ [Clue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo "Cluedo") was released, and _The Office_ [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game) "Monopoly (game)") was released in 2010. Other merchandise, from T-shirts and a [bobblehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobblehead "Bobblehead") doll of Dwight Schrute[\[201\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-201) to more office-specific items such as Dunder Mifflin copy paper[\[202\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-202) and parodies of the [Successories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successories "Successories") motivational poster series featuring the cast[\[203\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-203) are available. Dunder Mifflin had two websites,[\[204\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-204) and the cast members maintained blogs both as themselves and in character.

### Cast blogs

Several members of the cast maintained blogs on [MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace "MySpace"), including Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, and Brian Baumgartner, who posted regularly during the season.[\[205\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-205) [Rainn Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson "Rainn Wilson") wrote in character as Dwight for the "Schrute Space" blog on NBC.com, which was updated periodically. However, he stopped writing the blog himself.[\[206\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-206) It is unknown whether [Creed Bratton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_Bratton "Creed Bratton") authors "Creed Thoughts," the blog attributed to [his character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_Bratton_(character) "Creed Bratton (character)").[\[207\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-Creed_Thoughts-207)

### Cast podcast

On September 11, 2019, [Jenna Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer "Jenna Fischer") and [Angela Kinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Kinsey "Angela Kinsey") announced their podcast called _Office Ladies_ which premiered on October 16, 2019, on [Earwolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earwolf "Earwolf"). The podcast features Fischer and Kinsey watching episodes of _The Office_ and offering behind-the-scenes details and answering fan questions.[\[208\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-208) The theme song for the podcast, "Rubber Tree" is performed by [Creed Bratton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_Bratton "Creed Bratton").[\[209\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-209)

## Proposed spin-offs

A [spin-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media) "Spin-off (media)") to the series was proposed in 2008,[\[216\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-216) with a [pilot episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot "Television pilot") expected to debut as the [Super Bowl lead-out program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_lead-out_programs "List of Super Bowl lead-out programs") in 2009.[\[217\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-217) However, _The Office_'s creative team instead decided to develop _[Parks and Recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation "Parks and Recreation")_ as a separate series.[\[218\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-218) The idea created by the writers was that a copy machine breaks in _The Office_ and then it is shipped to Pawnee, Indiana, the setting of _Parks and Recreation_, to be fixed. Also, actress Rashida Jones was to portray a different character in both, causing a problem for the potential spin-off.[\[219\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-219)

Another spin-off starring Rainn Wilson as Dwight Schrute running a bed-and-breakfast and beet farm, titled _The Farm,_ was proposed in early 2012.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-liebersteinleaving-5)[\[220\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-hitfix-220) In October 2012, however, NBC decided not to go forward with the series.[\[221\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-221) A [backdoor pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_pilot "Backdoor pilot") episode was produced, and although the show was not picked up, it was modified to air during the ninth season as "[The Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farm_(The_Office) "The Farm (The Office)")".[\[220\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-hitfix-220)[\[222\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-222)

## Reboot

In September 2019, with the announcement of [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal "NBCUniversal")'s streaming service [Peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service) "Peacock (streaming service)"), [Bonnie Hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Hammer "Bonnie Hammer"), Chairman of Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises at [NBCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal_Cable_Entertainment_Group "NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group") stated that it is her "hope and goal that we do an _Office_ reboot".[\[223\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)#cite_note-223)

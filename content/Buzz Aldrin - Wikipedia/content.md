Born in [Glen Ridge, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Ridge,_New_Jersey "Glen Ridge, New Jersey"), Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the [United States Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy "United States Military Academy") at West Point, with a degree in [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"). He was commissioned into the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force"), and served as a jet [fighter pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot "Fighter pilot") during the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War"). He flew 66 [combat missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_warfare "Aerial warfare") and shot down two [MiG-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-15 "MiG-15") aircraft.

After earning a [Sc.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc.D. "Sc.D.") degree in [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics") from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"), Aldrin was selected as a member of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Astronaut Group 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut_Group_3 "Astronaut Group 3"), making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis was _Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous_, earning him the nickname "Dr. Rendezvous" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on [Gemini 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_12 "Gemini 12") during which he spent over five hours on [extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity"). Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 ([UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time")), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while [command module pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_module_pilot "Command module pilot") [Michael Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut) "Michael Collins (astronaut)") remained in lunar orbit. A [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_(U.S.A.) "Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)") [elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(Presbyterian) "Elder (Presbyterian)"), Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took [communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist").

Upon leaving NASA in 1971, Aldrin became Commandant of the [U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force_Test_Pilot_School "U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School"). He retired from the Air Force in 1972, after 21 years of service. His autobiographies _Return to Earth_ (1973), and _[Magnificent Desolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificent_Desolation_(book) "Magnificent Desolation (book)")_ (2009), recount his struggles with [clinical depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression "Clinical depression") and [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism "Alcoholism") in the years after leaving NASA. He continued to advocate for space exploration, particularly a [human mission to Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars "Human mission to Mars"), and developed the [Aldrin cycler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrin_cycler "Aldrin cycler"), a special spacecraft [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory") that makes travel to Mars more efficient in regard to time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the [Presidential Medal of Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom "Presidential Medal of Freedom") in 1969, and is listed in several [Halls of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_halls_and_walks_of_fame "List of halls and walks of fame").

## Early life

Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. was born on January 20, 1930, at [Mountainside Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountainside_Hospital "Mountainside Hospital") in [Glen Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Ridge,_New_Jersey "Glen Ridge, New Jersey"), [New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey "New Jersey").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-Record20090721-1) His parents, [Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Eugene_Aldrin_Sr. "Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr.") and Marion Aldrin ([née](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9e "Née") Moon), lived in neighboring [Montclair, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montclair,_New_Jersey "Montclair, New Jersey").[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005348%E2%80%93349-2) His father was an Army aviator during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and the assistant commandant of the Army's test pilot school at [McCook Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCook_Field "McCook Field"), Ohio, from 1919 to 1922, but left the Army in 1928 and became an executive at [Standard Oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil "Standard Oil").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201687%E2%80%9388-3) Aldrin had two siblings, both sisters: Madeleine, who was four years older, and Fay Ann, who was a year and a half older.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005349-4) His nickname, which became his legal first name in 1988,[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-:0-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTENelson200950-6) arose as a result of Fay's mispronouncing "brother" as "buzzer", which was then shortened to "Buzz".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005349-4)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007585-7) He was a [Boy Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouts_BSA_(Boy_Scouts_of_America) "Scouts BSA (Boy Scouts of America)"), with the rank of [Tenderfoot Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderfoot_Scout "Tenderfoot Scout").[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-8)

Aldrin did well in school, maintaining an A average.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-courierpost-9) He played [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football "American football") and was the starting [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(gridiron_football) "Center (gridiron football)") for [Montclair High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montclair_High_School_(New_Jersey) "Montclair High School (New Jersey)")'s undefeated 1946 state champion team.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-11) His father wanted him to go to the [United States Naval Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy "United States Naval Academy") in [Annapolis, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland "Annapolis, Maryland") and enrolled him at nearby [Severn School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_School "Severn School"), a [preparatory school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College-preparatory_school "College-preparatory school") for Annapolis and even secured him an appointment from [Albert W. Hawkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_W._Hawkes "Albert W. Hawkes"), one of the [United States Senators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senator "United States Senator") from New Jersey.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005351-12) Aldrin attended Severn School in 1946,[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-13) but had other ideas about his future career. He suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes. He faced down his father and told him to ask Hawkes to change the nomination to the [United States Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy "United States Military Academy") at [West Point, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point,_New_York "West Point, New York").[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005351-12)

Aldrin entered West Point in 1947.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-:0-5) He did well academically, finishing first in his class his plebe (first) year.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-courierpost-9) He was a member of the academy [track and field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field "Track and field") team.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201692-14) In 1950 he traveled with a group of West Point cadets to Japan and the Philippines to study the military government policies of [Douglas MacArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur "Douglas MacArthur").[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201689-15) During his trip, the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War") broke out.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200936-16) On June 5, 1951, he graduated third in the class of 1951 with a [Bachelor of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science "Bachelor of Science") degree in [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering").[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECullum1960588-17)

## Military career

As one of the highest-ranking members of the class, Aldrin had his choice of assignments. He chose the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force"), which had become a separate service in 1947 while Aldrin was still at West Point and did not yet have its own academy.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201689%E2%80%9390-18)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-19) He was commissioned as a [second lieutenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_lieutenant "Second lieutenant"), and underwent basic flight training in [T-6 Texans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-6_Texan "T-6 Texan") at [Bartow Air Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartow_Air_Base "Bartow Air Base") in [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida "Florida"). His classmates included [Sam Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Johnson "Sam Johnson"), who later became a [prisoner of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war "Prisoner of war") in Vietnam; the two became friends. At one point, Aldrin attempted a double [Immelmann turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immelmann_turn "Immelmann turn") in a [T-28 Trojan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-28_Trojan "T-28 Trojan") and suffered a [grayout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayout "Grayout"). He recovered in time to pull out at 200 feet (61 m), averting what would have been a fatal crash.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201690-20)

![Aldrin in a cockpit with canopy pulled back](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Buzz_Aldrin_in_the_cockpit_of_an_F-86_Sabre.png/220px-Buzz_Aldrin_in_the_cockpit_of_an_F-86_Sabre.png)

Aldrin in the cockpit of a [51st Fighter Interceptor Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51st_Fighter_Interceptor_Wing "51st Fighter Interceptor Wing") [F-86 Sabre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-86_Sabre "F-86 Sabre") after shooting down a [MiG 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG_15 "MiG 15") fighter during the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War")

When Aldrin was deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly, his father advised him to choose [bombers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber "Bomber"), because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills, which could open up better prospects for career advancement. Aldrin chose instead to fly [fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft "Fighter aircraft"). He moved to [Nellis Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellis_Air_Force_Base "Nellis Air Force Base") in [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas "Las Vegas"), where he learned to fly the [F-80 Shooting Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-80_Shooting_Star "F-80 Shooting Star") and the [F-86 Sabre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-86_Sabre "F-86 Sabre"). Like most jet [fighter pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot "Fighter pilot") of the era, he preferred the latter.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201690-20)

In December 1952, Aldrin was assigned to the [16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Fighter-Interceptor_Squadron "16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron"), which was part of the [51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51st_Fighter-Interceptor_Wing "51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing"). At the time it was based at [Suwon Air Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suwon_Air_Base "Suwon Air Base"), about 20 miles (32 km) south of [Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul "Seoul"), and was engaged in combat operations as part of the Korean War.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECullum1960588-17)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200990%E2%80%9391-21) During an acclimatization flight his main fuel system froze at 100percent power, which would have soon used up all his fuel. He was able to override the setting manually, but this required holding a button down, which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio. He barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence. He flew 66 [combat missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_warfare "Aerial warfare") in F-86 Sabres in Korea and shot down two [MiG-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-15 "MiG-15") aircraft.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200990%E2%80%9391-21)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201690%E2%80%9391-22)

The first Mig-15 he shot down was on May 14, 1953. Aldrin was flying about 5 miles (8.0 km) south of the [Yalu River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalu_River "Yalu River"), when he saw two MiG-15 fighters below him. Aldrin opened fire on one of the MiGs, whose pilot may never have seen him coming.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200990%E2%80%9391-21)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201691-23) The June 8, 1953, issue of _[Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine) "Life (magazine)")_ magazine featured gun camera footage taken by Aldrin of the pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-24)

![six shots of a MiG, showing the pilot bailing out](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/EJECTION_OF_A_MIG_PILOT_-_This_unusual_sequence_of_photos%2C_taken_by_gun_camera_film_of_a_U.S._Air_Force_F-86_%22Sabre%22..._-_NARA_-_542261.tif/lossy-page1-220px-EJECTION_OF_A_MIG_PILOT_-_This_unusual_sequence_of_photos%2C_taken_by_gun_camera_film_of_a_U.S._Air_Force_F-86_%22Sabre%22..._-_NARA_-_542261.tif.jpg)

Aldrin's gun camera footage featured in _Life_ magazine

Aldrin's second aerial victory came on June 4, 1953, when he accompanied aircraft from the [39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/39th_Fighter-Interceptor_Squadron "39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron") in an attack on an airbase in North Korea. Their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up. He then spotted a MiG approaching from above. This time, Aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about the same time. They went through a series of [scissor maneuvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scissors "The Scissors"), attempting to get behind the other. Aldrin was first to do so, but his gun sight jammed. He then manually sighted his gun and fired. He then had to pull out, as the two aircraft had gotten too low for the dogfight to continue. Aldrin saw the MiG's canopy open and the pilot eject, although Aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201691-23)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200991%E2%80%9393-25) For his service in Korea, he was awarded two [Distinguished Flying Crosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_States) "Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)") and three [Air Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Medal "Air Medal").[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-West_Point-26)

Aldrin's year-long tour ended in December 1953, by which time the fighting in Korea had ended. Aldrin was assigned as an [aerial gunnery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gunner "Air gunner") instructor at Nellis.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECullum1960588-17) In December 1954 he became an [aide-de-camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide-de-camp "Aide-de-camp") to [Brigadier General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier_General_(United_States) "Brigadier General (United States)") [Don Z. Zimmerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Z._Zimmerman "Don Z. Zimmerman"), the [Dean of Faculty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_Faculty "Dean of Faculty") at the nascent [United States Air Force Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy "United States Air Force Academy"), which opened in 1955.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nasabio-27)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005354-28) That same year, he graduated from the [Squadron Officer School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squadron_Officer_School "Squadron Officer School") at [Maxwell Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Air_Force_Base "Maxwell Air Force Base") in [Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama "Alabama").[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005353-29) From 1956 to 1959 he flew [F-100 Super Sabres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-100_Super_Sabre "F-100 Super Sabre") equipped with [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon") as a flight commander in the [22nd Fighter Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_Fighter_Squadron "22nd Fighter Squadron"), [36th Fighter Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_Fighter_Wing "36th Fighter Wing"), stationed at [Bitburg Air Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitburg_Air_Base "Bitburg Air Base") in West Germany.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECullum1960588-17)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201691-23)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nasabio-27) Among his squadron colleagues was [Ed White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_White_(astronaut) "Ed White (astronaut)"), who had been a year behind him at West Point. After White left Germany to study for a master's degree at the [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan") in [aeronautical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_engineering "Aeronautical engineering"), he wrote to Aldrin encouraging him to do the same.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201692-14)

![Aldrin in cockpit, canopy tilted up](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Buzz_Aldrin_in_the_cockpit_of_a_Lockheed_T-33A_Shooting_Star.jpg/220px-Buzz_Aldrin_in_the_cockpit_of_a_Lockheed_T-33A_Shooting_Star.jpg)

Aldrin in the cockpit of a [Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_T-33A_Shooting_Star "Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star") as an instructor at [Bryan Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Air_Force_Base "Bryan Air Force Base"), Texas

Through the [Air Force Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Institute_of_Technology "Air Force Institute of Technology"), Aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") (MIT) in 1959, intending to earn a master's degree.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007139-30) His [astrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics "Astrodynamics") class was taught by [Richard Battin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Battin "Richard Battin"). Two other USAF officers who later became astronauts, [David Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott "David Scott") and [Edgar Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Mitchell "Edgar Mitchell") took this course around this time, while another, [Charles Duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Duke "Charles Duke") wrote his 1964 master's degree at MIT under the supervision of [Laurence R. Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_R._Young "Laurence R. Young").[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-31)

Aldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007139-30) In January 1963, he earned a [Sc.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc.D. "Sc.D.") degree in [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics").[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nasabio-27)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-dspace.mit.edu-32) His doctoral thesis was _Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous_, the dedication of which read: "In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country's present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!"[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-dspace.mit.edu-32) Aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in the hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut, although it meant foregoing [test pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot "Test pilot") training, which was a prerequisite at the time.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007139-30)

On the completion of his doctorate, Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"),[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201692-14) working with the [Lockheed Aircraft Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Aircraft_Corporation "Lockheed Aircraft Corporation") on enhancing the maneuver capabilities of the [Agena target vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agena_target_vehicle "Agena target vehicle") which was to be used by [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Project Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini"). He was then posted to the Space Systems Division's field office at NASA's [Manned Spacecraft Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Spacecraft_Center "Manned Spacecraft Center") in [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston "Houston"), where he was involved in integrating [Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense") experiments into Project Gemini flights.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgess2013285-33)

## NASA career

Aldrin's initial application to join the astronaut corps when NASA's [Astronaut Group 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut_Group_2 "Astronaut Group 2") was selected in 1962 was rejected on the grounds that he was not a test pilot. He was aware of the requirement and asked for it to be waived, but the request was turned down.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgess2013203-34) On May 15, 1963, NASA announced another round of selections, this time with the requirement that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1,000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgess2013199-35) Aldrin had over 2,500 hours of flying time, of which 2,200 was in jets.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgess2013285-33) His selection as one of fourteen members of NASA's [Astronaut Group 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut_Group_3 "Astronaut Group 3") was announced on October 18, 1963.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-36) This made him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree which, combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics, earned him the nickname "Dr. Rendezvous" from his fellow astronauts.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007143-37)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-38)[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-39) Aldrin was aware it was not always intended as a compliment.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrier201692-14) Upon completion of initial training, each new astronaut was assigned a field of expertise – in Aldrin's case, it was mission planning, trajectory analysis and flight plans.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgess2013322-40)[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollins2001100-41)

### Gemini program

Main article: [Project Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini")

[Jim Lovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lovell "Jim Lovell") and Aldrin were selected as the backup crew of [Gemini 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_10 "Gemini 10"), commander and pilot respectively. Backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission, but the last scheduled mission in the program was [Gemini 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_12 "Gemini 12").[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005357-42) The February 28, 1966, deaths of the [Gemini 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_9 "Gemini 9") prime crew, [Elliot See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_See "Elliot See") and [Charles Bassett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bassett "Charles Bassett"), in an [air crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_NASA_T-38_crash "1966 NASA T-38 crash"), led to Lovell and Aldrin being moved up one mission to backup for Gemini 9, which put them in position as prime crew for Gemini 12.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1974323%E2%80%93325-43)[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin200751-44) They were designated its prime crew on June 17, 1966, with [Gordon Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper "Gordon Cooper") and [Gene Cernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Cernan "Gene Cernan") as their backups.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1974354-45)

#### Gemini 12

Main article: [Gemini 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_12 "Gemini 12")

![Astronaut performing EVA](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/S66-63536.jpg/220px-S66-63536.jpg)

Aldrin stands in space while in the [Gemini 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_12 "Gemini 12") spacecraft, with Earth in the background.

Initially, Gemini 12's mission objectives were uncertain. As the last scheduled mission, it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1974370%E2%80%93371-46) While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous during Project Gemini, the [gravity-gradient stabilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity-gradient_stabilization "Gravity-gradient stabilization") test on [Gemini 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_11 "Gemini 11") was unsuccessful. NASA also had concerns about [extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity") (EVA). Cernan on Gemini9 and [Richard Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_F._Gordon_Jr. "Richard F. Gordon Jr.") on Gemini11 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during EVA, but [Michael Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut) "Michael Collins (astronaut)") had a successful EVA on Gemini 10, which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReichl2016137%E2%80%93138-47)[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1974372%E2%80%93373-48)

It therefore fell to Aldrin to complete Gemini's EVA goals. NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success. It dropped the test of the Air Force's astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) that had given Gordon trouble on Gemini11 so Aldrin could focus on EVA. NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over [parabolic flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_flight "Parabolic flight"). Aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training, but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest. It also encouraged performing tasks quickly, whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately. Training in a viscous, buoyant fluid gave a better simulation. NASA also placed additional handholds on the capsule, which were increased from nine on Gemini9 to 44 on Gemini12, and created workstations where he could anchor his feet.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReichl2016137%E2%80%93138-47)[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1974372%E2%80%93373-48)

![Astronaut performing EVA](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Aldrin_Performs_EVA_%289449354819%29.jpg/220px-Aldrin_Performs_EVA_%289449354819%29.jpg)

Aldrin next to the [Agena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agena_Target_Vehicle "Agena Target Vehicle") work station

Gemini 12's main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization, perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three EVAs, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. Gemini12 also carried 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nssdc-49) It was not a trailblazing mission; rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by Gemini 9, and the tethered vehicle exercise by Gemini 11. Even gravity-gradient stabilization had been attempted by Gemini 11, albeit unsuccessfully.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1974372%E2%80%93373-48)

Gemini12 was launched from [Launch Complex 19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_Complex_19 "Launch Complex 19") at [Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral "Cape Canaveral") on 20:46 UTC on November 11, 1966. The [Gemini Agena Target Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Agena_Target_Vehicle "Gemini Agena Target Vehicle") had been launched about an hour and a half before.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nssdc-49) The mission's first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle. As the target and Gemini12 capsule drew closer together, radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable, forcing the crew to rendezvous manually. Aldrin used a [sextant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant "Sextant") and rendezvous charts he helped create to give Lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to dock with the target vehicle.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007140-50) Gemini12 achieved the fourth [docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft "Docking and berthing of spacecraft") with an Agena target vehicle.[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1974375%E2%80%93376-51)

The next task was to practice undocking and docking again. On undocking, one of the three latches caught, and Lovell had to use the Gemini's thrusters to free the spacecraft. Aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later. The flight plan then called for the Agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit, but eight minutes after the Agena had been launched, it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure. The Mission and Flight Directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine. This would be the only mission objective that was not achieved.[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1974375%E2%80%93376-51) Instead, the Agena's secondary propulsion system was used to allow the spacecraft to view the [solar eclipse of November 12, 1966](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_November_12,_1966 "Solar eclipse of November 12, 1966"), over South America, which Lovell and Aldrin photographed through the spacecraft windows.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nssdc-49)

![Astronauts in spacesuits exiting helicopter on aircraft carrier](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Gemini_12_recovery.jpg/220px-Gemini_12_recovery.jpg)

Aldrin and [Jim Lovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lovell "Jim Lovell") arrive on the aircraft carrier [USS _Wasp_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wasp_(CV-18) "USS Wasp (CV-18)") after the Gemini12 mission.

Aldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and twenty minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. Aldrin performed numerous tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for [Project Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Apollo "Project Apollo"). A dozen two-minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued. His second EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nssdc-49)[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReichl2016141%E2%80%93142-52)

On November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and [splashed down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown "Splashdown") in the Atlantic Ocean, where they were picked up by a helicopter, which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier [USS _Wasp_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wasp_(CV-18) "USS Wasp (CV-18)").[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nssdc-49)[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReichl2016142-53) After the mission, his wife realized he had fallen into a depression, something she had not seen before.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007140-50)

### Apollo program

Main article: [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program")

Lovell and Aldrin were assigned to an Apollo crew with [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong") as Commander, Lovell as Command Module Pilot (CMP), and Aldrin as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). Their assignment as the backup crew of [Apollo 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_9 "Apollo 9") was announced on November 20, 1967.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooksGrimwoodSwenson1979374-54) Due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module (LM), [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8") and Apollo9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Under the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was expected to command [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11").[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005312%E2%80%93313-55)

![Aldrin and Armstrong performing geological training in desert](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Neil_%28left%29_watches_Buzz_take_a_documentary_photo_of_a_sample.jpg/220px-Neil_%28left%29_watches_Buzz_take_a_documentary_photo_of_a_sample.jpg)

Aldrin photographs a geological specimen while [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong") looks on.

Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo8 prime crew, required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollins2001288%E2%80%93289-56) Lovell took his place on the Apollo8 crew. When Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, [Fred Haise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Haise "Fred Haise") filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECunningham2010109-57) While the CMP usually occupied the center couch on launch, Aldrin occupied it rather than Collins, as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before Collins arrived.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollins2001359-58)

Apollo11 was the second American space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space,[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff200090-59) the first being Apollo 10.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff200072-60) The next would not be flown until [STS-26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-26 "STS-26") in 1988.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff200090-59) [Deke Slayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deke_Slayton "Deke Slayton"), who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments, gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong thought it over for a day before declining. He had no issues working with Aldrin, and thought Lovell deserved his own command.[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHansen2005338%E2%80%93339-61)

Early versions of the EVA checklist had the Lunar Module Pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007148-62) Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin "resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second".[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollins200160-63) Aldrin and Armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training. The first lunar landing focused more on landing on the Moon and making it safely back to Earth than the scientific aspects of the mission. The duo were briefed by NASA and [USGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USGS "USGS") geologists. They made one geological field trip to [West Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas "West Texas"). The press followed them, and a helicopter made it hard for Aldrin and Armstrong to hear their instructor.[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007179-64)

#### Apollo 11

Main article: [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11")

On the morning of July 16, 1969, an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of [Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral "Cape Canaveral"), Florida. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more listened to radio broadcasts.[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBilstein1980369%E2%80%93370-65)[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBensonFaherty1978474-66) Propelled by a [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V "Saturn V") rocket, Apollo11 lifted off from [Launch Complex 39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_Complex_39 "Launch Complex 39") at the [Kennedy Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center "Kennedy Space Center") on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC "UTC") (9:32:00 [EDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Daylight_Time "Eastern Daylight Time")),[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-67) and entered Earth orbit twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the [S-IVB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-IVB "S-IVB") third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About thirty minutes later, the [transposition, docking, and extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition,_docking,_and_extraction "Transposition, docking, and extraction") maneuver was performed: this involved separating the [command module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_module "Apollo command module") _Columbia_ from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with [lunar module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_module "Lunar module") _Eagle_. After the lunar module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff2000102%E2%80%93110-68)

Aldrin's first words after he set foot on the Moon

On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter [lunar orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit "Lunar orbit").[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff2000102%E2%80%93110-68) In the thirty orbits that followed,[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-Apollo-11_(27)-69) the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern [Sea of Tranquillity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Tranquillity "Sea of Tranquillity") about 12 miles (19 km) southwest of the crater [Sabine D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_(crater) "Collins (crater)").[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-70) At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered _Eagle_, and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 _Eagle_ separated from the _Columbia_.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff2000102%E2%80%93110-68) Collins, alone aboard _Columbia_, inspected _Eagle_ as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear had correctly deployed.[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEManned_Spacecraft_Center19699-71)[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollinsAldrin1975209-72)

Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the _Eagle_.[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMindell2008226-73) Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800 m) above the surface of the Moon, the [LM guidance computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer "Apollo Guidance Computer") (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollinsAldrin1975210%E2%80%93212-74) The _Eagle_ landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-ALSJ_1-75)

As a [Presbyterian elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(Presbyterian) "Elder (Presbyterian)"), Aldrin was the first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. He radioed Earth: "I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way."[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007205-76) Using a kit given to him by his pastor,[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFarmerHamblin1970251-77) he took [communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") and read Jesus's words from the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament")'s John 15:5, as Aldrin records it: "I am the vine. You are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me."[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200926%E2%80%9327;_online:_https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey9qaUExkAwC&q=vine#v=snippet&q=vine&f=false.-78) But he kept this ceremony secret because of a lawsuit over the [reading of Genesis on Apollo8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8_Genesis_reading "Apollo 8 Genesis reading").[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007204-79) In 1970 he commented: "It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements."[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-80) On reflection in his 2009 book, Aldrin said, "Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind – be they [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians"), [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews"), [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims"), [animists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animists "Animists"), [agnostics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostics "Agnostics"), or [atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheists "Atheists"). But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo11 experience than by giving thanks to God."[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200927-81) Aldrin shortly hit upon a more universally human reference on the voyage back to Earth by publicly broadcasting his reading of the [Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament "Old Testament")'s Psalm 8:3–4, as Aldrin records: "When I considered the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200951%E2%80%9352;_online:_https://books.google.com/books?id=HRlO8_7mzH0C&lpg=PA51&vq=Psalms&pg=PA52#v.-82) Photos of these liturgical documents reveal the conflict's development as Aldrin expresses faith.[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-83)

Preparations for the EVA began at 23:43.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff2000102%E2%80%93110-68) Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, _Eagle_ was depressurized, and the hatch was opened at 02:39:33 on July 21.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff2000102%E2%80%93110-68)[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECortright1975215-84) Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff2000102%E2%80%93110-68) Armstrong and Aldrin became the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. Aldrin's first words after he set foot on the Moon were "Beautiful view", to which Armstrong asked "Isn't that something? Magnificent sight out here." Aldrin answered, "Magnificent desolation."[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-85) Aldrin and Armstrong had trouble erecting the [Lunar Flag Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Flag_Assembly "Lunar Flag Assembly"), but with some effort secured it into the surface. Aldrin saluted the flag and Armstrong took an iconic photo of the scene. Aldrin positioned himself in front of the video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about the lunar surface to aid future moonwalkers.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007212%E2%80%93213-86) During his experiments, President Nixon called the duo to congratulate them on the successful landing. Nixon closed with, "Thank you very much, and all of us look forward to seeing you on the _Hornet_ on Thursday."[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007215-87) Aldrin replied, "I look forward to that very much, sir."[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007215-87)[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007214%E2%80%93215-88)

After the call, Aldrin began photographing and inspecting the spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight. Aldrin and Armstrong then set up a seismometer to detect moonquakes and a laser beam reflector. While Armstrong inspected a crater, Aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChaikin2007216%E2%80%93217-89)

Aldrin's lunar bootprint in a photo taken by him on July 21, 1969

Most of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the Moon taken by the Apollo11 astronauts are of Aldrin; Armstrong appears in just two color photographs. "As the sequence of lunar operations evolved," Aldrin explained, "Neil had the camera most of the time, and the majority of the pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn't until we were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this during our training."[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-Missing_Man-90)

Aldrin reentered _Eagle_ first, but, before ascending the ladder, he was the first human to urinate on the Moon.[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-91) With some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5 lb) of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device.[\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-ALSJ_3-92) Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. It contained a mission patch for the [Apollo 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1 "Apollo 1") flight that Ed White never flew due to his death in a cabin fire during the launch rehearsal; medallions commemorating [Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin"), the first man in space, and [Vladimir Komarov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Komarov "Vladimir Komarov"), the first man to die in a space flight, and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations.[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200941-93) After transferring to LM [life support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support "Life support"), the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty [Hasselblad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasselblad "Hasselblad") camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01, and they repressurized the lunar module and settled down to sleep.[\[94\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-ALSJ_6-94)

At 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in _Eagle_'s ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard _Columbia_ in lunar orbit.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff2000102%E2%80%93110-68) After rendezvous with _Columbia_, the ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit, and _Columbia_ made its way back to Earth.[\[95\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-95) It splashed down in the Pacific 2,660 km (1,440 nmi) east of [Wake Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Island "Wake Island") at 16:50 UTC (05:50 local time) on July 24.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff2000102%E2%80%93110-68)[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-ALSJ_Re-entry-96) The total mission duration was 195 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds.[\[97\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrloff200098-97)

The chance of bringing back [pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen "Pathogen") from the lunar surface was considered a remote possibility, so divers passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter, and flown to the aircraft carrier [USS _Hornet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hornet_(CV-12) "USS Hornet (CV-12)"),[\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEManned_Spacecraft_Center1969164%E2%80%93167-98) where they spent the first part of the Earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine.[\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarmichael2010199%E2%80%93200-99) On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million people.[\[100\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-100) An official [state dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_dinner "State dinner") that evening in Los Angeles celebrated the flight. President [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") honored each of them with the highest American civilian award, the [Presidential Medal of Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom "Presidential Medal of Freedom") (with distinction).[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-LADinner-101)[\[102\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-102)

On September 16, 1969, the astronauts addressed a [joint session of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress "Joint session of the United States Congress") where they thanked the representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding the space effort.[\[103\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-103)[\[104\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-104) The astronauts embarked on a 38-day world tour on September 29 that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries.[\[105\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-105) The last leg of the tour included Australia, South Korea, and Japan; the crew returned to the US on November 5, 1969.[\[106\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-106)[\[107\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-107)

After Apollo 11, Aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances. In October 1970, he joined Soviet cosmonauts [Andriyan Nikolayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriyan_Nikolayev "Andriyan Nikolayev") and [Vitaly Sevastyanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaly_Sevastyanov "Vitaly Sevastyanov") on their tour of the NASA space centers. He was also involved in the design of the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"). With the Apollo program coming to an end, Aldrin, now a [colonel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_(United_States) "Colonel (United States)"), saw few prospects at NASA, and decided to return to the Air Force on July 1, 1971.[\[108\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200981%E2%80%9387-108) During his NASA career, he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space, of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in EVA.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-nasabio-27)

## Post-NASA activities

### Aerospace Research Pilot School

![Aldrin in an air force colonel's uniform, with five rows of ribbons and astronaut wings.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Buzz_Aldrin_black_and_white_dress_uniform_photo_portrait.jpg/220px-Buzz_Aldrin_black_and_white_dress_uniform_photo_portrait.jpg)

Aldrin as Commandant of the Air Force Test Pilot School

Aldrin hoped to become Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, but the job went to his West Point classmate [Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoyt_S._Vandenberg_Jr. "Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr.") Aldrin was made Commandant of the [USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force_Test_Pilot_School "U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School") at [Edwards Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_Air_Force_Base "Edwards Air Force Base"), California. Aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience, but a third of the training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified [F-104 Starfighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_NF-104A "Lockheed NF-104A") to the edge of space.[\[109\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200988%E2%80%9389-109) Fellow Group 3 astronaut and moonwalker [Alan Bean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bean "Alan Bean") considered him well qualified for the job.[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009120%E2%80%93121-110)

Aldrin did not get along well with his superior, Brigadier General [Robert M. White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._White "Robert M. White"), who had earned his USAF [astronaut wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge "United States Astronaut Badge") flying the [X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-15 "X-15"). Aldrin's celebrity status led people to defer to him more than the higher-ranking general.[\[111\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009113%E2%80%93114-111) There were two crashes at Edwards, of an [A-7 Corsair II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-7_Corsair_II "A-7 Corsair II") and a [T-33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-33 "T-33"). No lives were lost, but the aircraft were destroyed and the accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision, which placed the blame on Aldrin. What he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful one.[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009116%E2%80%93120-112)

Aldrin went to see the base surgeon. In addition to signs of [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder "Major depressive disorder"), he experienced neck and shoulder pains, and hoped that the latter might explain the former.[\[113\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009100%E2%80%93103-113) He was hospitalized for depression at [Wilford Hall Medical Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilford_Hall_Medical_Center "Wilford Hall Medical Center") for four weeks.[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009105%E2%80%93109-114) His mother had committed suicide in May 1968, and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after Gemini12 had contributed. His mother's father had also committed suicide, and he believed he inherited depression from them.[\[115\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-115) At the time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career-ending, but could result in his being ostracized socially.[\[113\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009100%E2%80%93103-113)

In February 1972, [General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_(United_States) "General (United States)") [George S. Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Brown "George S. Brown") paid a visit to Edwards and informed Aldrin that the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School was being renamed the USAF Test Pilot School and the astronaut training was being dropped. With the Apollo program winding down, and Air Force budgets being cut, the Air Force's interest in space diminished.[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009116%E2%80%93120-112) Aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on March 1, 1972, after 21 years of service. His father and General [Jimmy Doolittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Doolittle "Jimmy Doolittle"), a close friend of his father, attended the formal retirement ceremony.[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009116%E2%80%93120-112)

### Post retirement

Aldrin's father died on December 28, 1974, from complications following a [heart attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_attack "Heart attack").[\[116\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009147%E2%80%93148-116) Aldrin's autobiographies _Return to Earth,_ (1973) and _[Magnificent Desolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificent_Desolation_(book) "Magnificent Desolation (book)")_ (2009), recounted his struggles with [clinical depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression "Clinical depression") and [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism "Alcoholism") in the years after leaving NASA.[\[117\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-117)[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-118)[\[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-119) Encouraged by a therapist to take a regular job, Aldrin worked selling used cars, at which he had no talent.[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009165%E2%80%93166-120) Periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking. Eventually he was arrested for [disorderly conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorderly_conduct "Disorderly conduct"). Finally, in October 1978, he quit drinking for good. Aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems, including actor [William Holden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Holden "William Holden"). Holden's girlfriend [Stefanie Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanie_Powers "Stefanie Powers") had portrayed Marianne, a woman with whom Aldrin had an affair, in the [TV movie version of _Return to Earth_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Earth_(film) "Return to Earth (film)"). Aldrin was saddened by Holden's alcohol-related death in 1981.[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009170%E2%80%93173-121)

### Bart Sibrel incident

On September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a [Beverly Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California "Beverly Hills, California") hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children's television show on the subject of space.[\[122\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-122) When he arrived, [Moon landing conspiracy theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories "Moon landing conspiracy theories") [Bart Sibrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Sibrel "Bart Sibrel") accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were not faked. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel followed Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, and called him "thief, liar and coward", the 72-year-old Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel's film crew. Aldrin said he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter. Witnesses said Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with a Bible. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no criminal record. The police declined to press charges against Aldrin.[\[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-123)[\[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-124)

![Five men in blue jump suits pose with Aldrin in an olive jump suit on the runway in front of a white F-16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Thunderbirds_pilots_pose_for_a_photo_with_Buzz_Aldrin.jpg/220px-Thunderbirds_pilots_pose_for_a_photo_with_Buzz_Aldrin.jpg)

[USAF Thunderbirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAF_Thunderbirds "USAF Thunderbirds") pilots pose for a photo with Aldrin prior to his flight at an air show in [Melbourne, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne,_Florida "Melbourne, Florida"), on April 2, 2017. Aldrin became the oldest person to fly with the Thunderbirds.[\[125\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-125)

### Detached adapter panel sighting

In 2005, while being interviewed for a [Science Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Channel "Science Channel") documentary titled _First on the Moon: The Untold Story_, Aldrin told an interviewer they had seen an unidentified flying object ([UFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object "Unidentified flying object")). The documentary makers omitted the crew's conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels from the upper stage of the SaturnV rocket. The panels had been jettisoned before the separation maneuver so they closely followed the spacecraft until the first mid-course correction. When Aldrin appeared on _[The Howard Stern Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Howard_Stern_Show "The Howard Stern Show")_ on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, "99.9 percent" sure the object was the detached panel.[\[126\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-126)[\[127\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-127) According to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to make a correction, but was refused.[\[128\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-128)

### Polar expedition

In December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the [Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott_South_Pole_Station "Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station") in [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to [McMurdo Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station "McMurdo Station") and from there to [Christchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch "Christchurch"), New Zealand.[\[129\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-129) At 86 years of age, Aldrin's visit made him the oldest person to reach the South Pole. He had traveled to the North Pole in 1998.[\[130\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-130)[\[131\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-131)

## Mission to Mars advocacy

![Aldrin (in a suit and tie) chats with Byerly and Spencer.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Buzz_in_Mission_Control_-_cropped.jpg/220px-Buzz_in_Mission_Control_-_cropped.jpg)

Aldrin in Mission Control with NASA spokesman [Josh Byerly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Byerly "Josh Byerly") and Flight Director Ron Spencer in 2009

After leaving NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the [University of North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Dakota "University of North Dakota") (UND)'s [College of Aerospace Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Odegard_School_of_Aerospace_Sciences "John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences") at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college. Aldrin helped to develop UND's Space Studies program and brought Dr. [David Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_C._Webb "David C. Webb") from NASA to serve as the department's first chair.[\[132\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-132) To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with [Snoop Dogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg "Snoop Dogg"), [Quincy Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones "Quincy Jones"), [Talib Kweli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talib_Kweli "Talib Kweli"), and [Soulja Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulja_Boy "Soulja Boy") to create the rap single and video "Rocket Experience", proceeds from which were donated to Aldrin's non-profit foundation, [ShareSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShareSpace_foundation "ShareSpace foundation").[\[133\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-133)

In 1985, Aldrin proposed a special spacecraft [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory") now known as the [Aldrin cycler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrin_cycler "Aldrin cycler").[\[134\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-134)[\[135\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-135) Cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to Mars by using less propellant. The Aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, with a return trip to Earth of the same duration on a twin cycler orbit. Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University.[\[136\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-136) In 1996 Aldrin founded Starcraft Boosters, Inc. (SBI) to design reusable rocket launchers.[\[137\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-137)

In December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_ criticizing NASA's objectives. In it, he voiced concern about NASA's development of a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft) "Orion (spacecraft)") "limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was "more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs".[\[138\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-Fly_Me_To_L1-138)

In a June 2013 opinion piece in _The New York Times_, Aldrin supported a [human mission to Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars "Human mission to Mars") and which viewed the Moon "not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species."[\[139\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-139) In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the [Florida Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Institute_of_Technology "Florida Institute of Technology"), presented a master plan to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a tour of duty of ten years, establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.[\[140\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-140)

Aldrin with his wife Lois

Aldrin has been married three times. His first marriage was on December 29, 1954, to Joan Archer, a [Rutgers University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University "Rutgers University") and [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") alumna with a master's degree. They had three children, James, Janice and Andrew. They filed for divorce in 1974.[\[170\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham200975-170)[\[171\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-171) His second was to Beverly Van Zile, whom he married on December 31, 1975,[\[172\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009154-172) and divorced in 1978. His third was to Lois Driggs Cannon, whom he married on February 14, 1988.[\[173\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAldrinAbraham2009224-173) Their divorce was finalized in December 2012. The settlement included 50percent of their $475,000 bank account, and $9,500 a month plus 30percent of his annual income, estimated at more than $600,000.[\[174\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-174)[\[175\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-175) As of 2017, he has one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter Janice, and three great-grandsons.[\[176\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-176)

His children alleged that he made new friends who were alienating him from the family and encouraging him to spend his savings at a high rate. They sought to be named legal guardians so they could control his finances.[\[177\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-177) In June, Aldrin filed a lawsuit against Andrew, Janice, Korp, and businesses and foundations run by the family.[\[178\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-178) Aldrin alleged that Janice was not acting in his financial interests and that Korp was exploiting the elderly.

The situation ended when his children withdrew their petition and he dropped the lawsuit in March 2019, several months before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo11 mission.[\[179\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin#cite_note-179)

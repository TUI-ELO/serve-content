A **blockchain**,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-fortune20160515-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-nyt20160521-3) originally **block chain**,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-primer-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-obmh-5) is a growing list of [records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science) "Record (computer science)"), called _blocks_, that are linked using [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-6) Each block contains a [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function "Cryptographic hash function") of the previous block,[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-6) a [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping "Trusted timestamping"), and transaction data (generally represented as a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree "Merkle tree")).

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hbr201701-7) For use as a [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger "Distributed ledger"), a blockchain is typically managed by a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Peer-to-peer") network collectively adhering to a [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(communication) "Protocol (communication)") for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered [secure by design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design "Secure by design") and exemplify a distributed computing system with high [Byzantine fault tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance "Byzantine fault tolerance"). [Decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized "Decentralized") consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-decapp-8)

Blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto "Satoshi Nakamoto") in 2008 to serve as the public transaction [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger "Ledger") of the [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency") [bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1) The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the [double-spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending "Double-spending") problem without the need of a trusted authority or central [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)"). The bitcoin design has inspired other applications,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-nyt20160521-3) and blockchains that are readable by the public are widely used by [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrencies "Cryptocurrencies"). Blockchain is considered a type of [payment rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_rail "Payment rail").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-9) Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Sources such as _Computerworld_ called the marketing of such blockchains without a proper security model "[snake oil](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/snake_oil "wiktionary:snake oil")".[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cw20160905-10)

## History

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Confirmed_Transactions_Per_Day.png/220px-Confirmed_Transactions_Per_Day.png)

Bitcoin transactions (January 2009 – September 2017)

The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-6)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-11) They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated [Merkle trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree "Merkle tree") to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-6)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-12)

The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto "Satoshi Nakamoto") in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a [Hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash "Hashcash")\-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and to reduce speed with which blocks are added to the chain.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-6) The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency [bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin"), where it serves as the public [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger "Ledger") for all transactions on the network.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)

In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB ([gigabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte "Gigabyte")).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hadi-13) In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.

The words _block_ and _chain_ were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, _blockchain,_ by 2016.

Smart contracts that run on a blockchain, for example, ones that "creat\[e\] invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates that automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1) require an off-chain [oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_(computer_science) "Oracle (computer science)") to access any "external data or events based on time or market conditions \[that need\] to interact with the blockchain".[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-bletchleyWP201609-14)

According to [Accenture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture "Accenture"), an application of the [diffusion of innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations "Diffusion of innovations") theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the [early adopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter "Early adopter") phase.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-tfob-15) Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the [Chamber of Digital Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Digital_Commerce "Chamber of Digital Commerce").

In May 2018, [Gartner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner "Gartner") found that only 1% of [CIOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_officer "Chief information officer") indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or \[looking at\] active experimentation with blockchain".[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-16)

## Structure

A blockchain is a [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing "Decentralized computing"), [distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing "Distributed computing"), and oftentimes public, digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved [record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_record "Storage record") cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-wired20161107-17) This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-:1-18) A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Peer-to-peer") network and a distributed timestamping server. They are [authenticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") by [mass collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_collaboration "Mass collaboration") powered by [collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective "Collective") [self-interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-interest "Self-interest").[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hwb-19) Such a design facilitates [robust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_(computer_science) "Robustness (computer science)") [workflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow "Workflow") where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction_(economics) "Reproduction (economics)") from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of [double spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_spending "Double spending"). A blockchain has been described as a _value-exchange protocol_.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-bc2.0-20) A blockchain can maintain [title rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(property) "Title (property)") because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels [offer and acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offer_and_acceptance "Offer and acceptance").

### Blocks

Blocks hold batches of valid [transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_processing "Transaction processing") that are hashed and encoded into a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree "Merkle tree").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1) Each block includes the [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash "Cryptographic hash") of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1) This [iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration") process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hadc-21)

Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hadc-21) Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-bsm-22) as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t12-23):ch. 08[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-paper-24) For example, bitcoin uses a [proof-of-work system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system "Proof-of-work system"), where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation"). Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing "Parallel computing") manner.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-permbloc-25)

#### Block time

The _block time_ is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum "Ethereum") is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

A _hard fork_ is a rule change such that the software validating according to the old rules will see the blocks produced according to the new rules as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes meant to work in accordance with the new rules need to upgrade their software.

If one group of nodes continues to use the old software while the other nodes use the new software, a permanent split can occur. For example, [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum "Ethereum") has hard-forked to "make whole" the investors in [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization) "The DAO (organization)"), which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum "Ethereum") and [Ethereum Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum_Classic "Ethereum Classic") chains. In 2014 the [Nxt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nxt "Nxt") community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major [cryptocurrency exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange "Cryptocurrency exchange"). The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-ArsFork-26)

### Decentralization

By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1) The decentralized blockchain may use [ad hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc "Ad hoc") [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing "Message passing") and [distributed networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_networking "Distributed networking").

Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that [computer crackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker "Security hacker") can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of [failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure "Failure"). Blockchain security methods include the use of [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography "Public-key cryptography").[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-primer-4):5 A _public key_ (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A _private key_ is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)

Every [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking) "Node (networking)") in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. [Data quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality "Data quality") is maintained by massive database [replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing) "Replication (computing)")[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-decapp-8) and [computational trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_trust "Computational trust"). No centralized "official" copy exists and no user is "trusted" more than any other.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-primer-4) Transactions are broadcast to the network using software. Messages are delivered on a [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery "Best-effort delivery") basis. Mining nodes validate transactions,[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hadc-21) add them to the block they are building, and then [broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking) "Broadcasting (networking)") the completed block to other nodes.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t12-23):ch. 08 Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system "Proof-of-work system"), to serialize changes.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-kopstein-27) Alternative consensus methods include [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake "Proof-of-stake").[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hadc-21) Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of [centralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality "Centrality") because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-28)

### Openness

Open blockchains are more [user-friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability "Usability") than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t16-29)[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t10-30)[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t11-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t8-32)[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t9-33) Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of [multiversion concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control "Multiversion concurrency control") (MVCC) in databases.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t4-34) Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-tapscott201605-35):30–31 Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t16-29)[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-t11-31) Nikolai Hampton of _[Computerworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerworld "Computerworld")_ said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cw20160905-10)[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-MarTech-36)

#### Permissionless

The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no [access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control "Access control") is needed.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-bsm-22) This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer").[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-bsm-22)

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses [Hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash "Hashcash") puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by [Adam Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back "Adam Back"), the original idea was first proposed by [Cynthia Dwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Dwork "Cynthia Dwork") and [Moni Naor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moni_Naor "Moni Naor") and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

Financial companies have not prioritised decentralized blockchains.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

In 2016, [venture capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital "Venture capital") investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-btt17-37) Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April 2018, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.

Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-btit-38) In contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner. They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they benefit from the [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect "Network effect").\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Permissioned blockchains can also go by the name of 'consortium' blockchains.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-39)\[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_\]

#### Disadvantages of private blockchain

Nikolai Hampton pointed out in _[Computerworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerworld "Computerworld")_ that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cw20160905-10) This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis "Financial crisis") or [debt crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_crisis "Debt crisis") like the [financial crisis of 2007–08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308 "Financial crisis of 2007–08"), where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-SalsmanTheFinancial13-40)[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-OKeeffeThePolitical15-41) and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's time consuming and expensive."[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cw20160905-10) He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases."[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cw20160905-10)

#### Blockchain analysis

The [analysis of public blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_analysis "Blockchain analysis") has become increasingly important with the popularity of [bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin"), [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum "Ethereum"), [litecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin "Litecoin") and other [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrencies "Cryptocurrencies").[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-42) A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how. The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto-exchanges and banks.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-43)[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-44) The reason for this is accusations of blockchain enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit [dark market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_market "Darknet market") trade of drugs, weapons, money laundering etc.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-45) A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is changing and now specialised tech-companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and [fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money "Fiat money") crypto exchanges. The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise use of new cryptos such as [Monero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero_(cryptocurrency) "Monero (cryptocurrency)").[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-46)[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-47)[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-48) The question is about public accessibility of blockchain data and the personal privacy of the very same data. It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in blockchain.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-49)

## Uses

Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger "Distributed ledger") for [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency"), most notably [bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin"). There are a few operational products maturing from [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept "Proof of concept") by late 2016.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-btt17-37) Businesses have been thus far reluctant to place blockchain at the core of the business structure.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-clsdips-50)

Blockchain-based [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract "Smart contract") are proposed contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-unbi-54) One of the main objectives of a smart contract is [automated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation "Automation") [escrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow "Escrow"). An [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce [moral hazards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard "Moral hazard") and optimize the use of contracts in general. But "no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged." Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-55)[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-vcab-56)

### Financial services

Major portions of the [financial industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_industry "Financial industry") are implementing [distributed ledgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger "Distributed ledger") for use in [banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking "Banking"),[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-reason20160506-57)[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-afr20160629-58)[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-59) and according to a September 2016 [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") study, this is occurring faster than expected.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Dramatic_Acceptance_of_Blockchain-60)

Banks are interested in this technology because it has potential to speed up [back office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_office "Back office") settlement systems.[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-inbl-61)

[Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank "Bank") such as [UBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS "UBS") are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-62)[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-63)

[Berenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenberg_Bank "Berenberg Bank"), a German bank, believes that blockchain is an "overhyped technology" that has had a large number of "proofs of concept", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Roy31102017-64)

The blockchain has also given rise to [Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering "Initial coin offering") as well as a new category of digital asset called Security Token Offerings (STOs), also sometimes referred to as Digital Security Offerings (DSOs).[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-65) STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on a public, regulated stock exchange and are used to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual property, real estate, art, or individual products. A number of companies are active in this space providing services for compliant tokenization, private STOs, and public STOs.

### Video games

A blockchain game _[CryptoKitties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties "CryptoKitties")_, launched in November 2017.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-66) The game made headlines in December 2017 when a cryptokitty character - an in-game [virtual pet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_pet "Virtual pet") - was sold for more than [US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar")100,000.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-67) _CryptoKitties_ illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network with about 30% of all Ethereum transactions being for the game.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-fortune-68)

_CryptoKitties_ also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets ([digital assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset "Digital asset")).[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-69)

### Supply chain

There are a number of efforts and industry organizations working to employ blockchains in [supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain "Supply chain") [logistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics "Logistics") and [supply chain management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management "Supply chain management").

The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) works to develop open standards for supply chains.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

Everledger is one of the inaugural clients of IBM's blockchain-based tracking service.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-wsj20160714-70)

[Walmart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart "Walmart") and [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") are running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for [supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain "Supply chain") monitoring — all nodes of the blockchain are administered by Walmart and are located on the IBM [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud computing").[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-71)

[Hyperledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger "Hyperledger") Grid develops open components for blockchain supply chain solutions.[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-72)[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-73)

### Other uses

Blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-74) or musicians.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-75) In 2017, IBM partnered with [ASCAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCAP "ASCAP") and [PRS for Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_for_Music "PRS for Music") to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-76) [Imogen Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imogen_Heap "Imogen Heap")'s Mycelia service has also been proposed as blockchain-based alternative "that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians."[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-BurchardiTheBlock18-77)[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-78)

New distribution methods are available for the [insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance "Insurance") industry such as [peer-to-peer insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_insurance "Peer-to-peer insurance"), [parametric insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_insurance "Parametric insurance") and [microinsurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microinsurance "Microinsurance") following the adoption of blockchain.[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-blis-79)[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-80) The [sharing economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy "Sharing economy") and [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things "Internet of Things") are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers.[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-breac-81) [Online voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_voting "Online voting") is another application of the blockchain.[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-ovpfaq-82)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-83) The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-84)

Other designs include:

*   [Hyperledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger "Hyperledger") is a cross-industry collaborative effort from the [Linux Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation "Linux Foundation") to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM)[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-85)
*   Quorum – a permissionable private blockchain by [JPMorgan Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase "JPMorgan Chase") with private storage, used for contract applications[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-86)
*   Tezos, decentralized voting.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-tapscott201605-35):94
*   [Proof of Existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence "Proof of Existence") is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a specific time[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-swan-2015-87)

## Types

Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, [consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium "Consortium") blockchains and hybrid blockchains.

### Public blockchains

A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") connection can send [transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction "Financial transaction") to it as well as become a [validator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validator "Validator") (i.e., participate in the execution of a [consensus protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science) "Consensus (computer science)")).[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Perfectial-88)\[_[self-published source?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_\] Usually, such networks offer [economic incentives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive "Incentive") for those who secure them and utilize some type of a [Proof of Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake "Proof-of-stake") or [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system "Proof-of-work system") algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.

### Private blockchains

A private blockchain is permissioned.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-btit-38) One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is [restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform "Closed platform").

### Hybrid blockchains

A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-89) The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization decentralization are used.

## Academic research

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/BlockchainPanelDiscussionAtIEEETechIgnite2017.jpg/220px-BlockchainPanelDiscussionAtIEEETechIgnite2017.jpg)

Blockchain panel discussion at the first [IEEE Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society "IEEE Computer Society") TechIgnite conference

In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-90)

### Blockchain and Internal Audit

The need for internal audit to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that information is accessed in new formats.[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-91) Blockchain adoption requires a framework to identify the risk of exposure associated with transactions using blockchain. The [Institute of Internal Auditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Internal_Auditors "Institute of Internal Auditors") has identified the need for internal auditors to address this transformational technology. New methods are required to develop audit plans that identify threats and risks. The Internal Audit Foundation study, _Blockchain and Internal Audit,_ assesses these factors. [\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-92) The AICPA has outlined new roles for auditors as a result of blockchain.[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-93)

### Energy use of proof-of-work blockchains

External video![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png)

The [Bank for International Settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements "Bank for International Settlements") has criticized the public [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work "Proof-of-work") blockchains for high energy consumption.[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-chapterV-96)[\[94\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-bis_report-94)[\[97\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-LATHiltzik-97) Nicholas Weaver, of the [International Computer Science Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computer_Science_Institute "International Computer Science Institute") at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley") examines blockchain's online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains, and in both cases finds it grossly inadequate.[\[95\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-VoxWeaver-95)[\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-WeaverLecture-98) The 31—45 TWh of electricity used for Bitcoin in 2018 produced 17—22.9 MtCO2.[\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Kohler-99)[\[100\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Stoll-100)

### Journals

Main article: [Ledger (journal)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger_(journal) "Ledger (journal)")

In September 2015, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research, _Ledger_, was announced. The inaugural issue was published in December 2016.[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Extance2015-101) The journal covers aspects of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") that relate to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.[\[102\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-102)[\[103\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-Hertig2015-103)

The journal encourages authors to [digitally sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature "Digital signature") a [file hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function "Hash function") of submitted papers, which are then [timestamped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping "Trusted timestamping") into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers for non-repudiation purposes.[\[104\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-104)
